Ummm anyways. Now you may be wondering why I chose my current oshi as the worst husband but again. Hear me out. Again, I'm probably wrong in quite a few places but this is just how I've interpreted the information I have üò≠\nCompletely ignoring that Kaname is knocked out, the way he handled relationships (from what we've seen) is generally unhealthy. He clings to people when they show him any love at all, and this is because of his past with his mother and what he's experienced. He'll do anything for the people he loves, and while this can be seen as a good thing, it can also be extremely harmful for him because he has no form of boundaries. He simply does as told, because he's afraid that his loved ones will stop loving him. While these are both good traits in moderation, he's overly obsessive with being and doing what everyone wants from him, leading him to have no will of his own. This is especially dangerous because it's what can, and will, cause him to develop a codependent relationship with who he loves. He could easily be taken advantage of, by the wrong person, and he likely wouldn't argue at all. By the end of Obbligato, he does change a bit and show some more will of his own, but he's still very much in danger of being manipulated by those he trusts and it would not be healthy for him to be in a relationship, or married, when he's like this. \nPersonally though, I also think that if he's shown genuine love and is cared for, he could be able to reach a healthier relationship with love in general. He'd have to learn that people do love him regardless of what he does, and that it's ok if he isn't perfect or doesn't do everything they ask of him. When he feels more secure in his relationships, he can start to be more comfortable with expressing himself. I can see that he's very caring and would absolutely do anything for his loved ones, but he needs to work on his overall perspective of relationships before he can get into a relationship or be married.\nThis really doesn't change the fact that I still love him a lot just... I hope he gets the love he deserves... I'm not completely sure about this, because I'm pretty sure I dreamed it up, but I feel like it's likely that his relationship with his mother could have been composed of her projecting what she wants in a man onto him (which is another theory for another day). But in any case, I don't think he's fit for romantic relationships or marriage just yet. He'd likely cause himself more harm than good, and I just hope he can see this and realize that he doesn't have to obsess over being perfect for others anymore."},{"id":-1,"name":"Kaname Tojo","reason":"I can't pay his medical bills.."},{"id":28,"name":"Kanata Shinkai","reason":"wet :("},{"id":28,"name":"Kanata Shinkai","reason":"Wet >:("},{"id":28,"name":"Kanata Shinkai","reason":"he loves to be in the water and I can‚Äôt swim </3"},{"id":28,"name":"Kanata Shinkai","reason":"The water bills..."},{"id":28,"name":"Kanata Shinkai","reason":"um obvious reasons. he will try to drown me"},{"id":28,"name":"Kanata Shinkai","reason":"please stop soaking in my clothes‚Ä¶. i need those for tomorrow :(‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"},{"id":28,"name":"Kanata Shinkai","reason":"Listen i love kanata but there is absolutely no way he would be a good spousw‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ my boy would take a bath in the washinf machine ^_^"},{"id":28,"name":"Kanata Shinkai","reason":"Would arrive completely soaked to our wedding"},{"id":28,"name":"Kanata Shinkai","reason":"im a cat"},{"id":28,"name":"Kanata Shinkai","reason":"i'm sorry, i don't think i can eat fish everyday"},{"id":28,"name":"Kanata Shinkai","reason":"Water bill :("},{"id":28,"name":"Kanata Shinkai","reason":"I'll die from food poisoning thanks to him."},{"id":28,"name":"Kanata Shinkai","reason":"wet socks are the worst sensation ever\nnow it will be wet everything 24/7\nhow is he not pruny all of the time\ni love  creatures but i dont want to walk into our bedroom and see a frog on my pillow"},{"id":28,"name":"Kanata Shinkai","reason":"i don‚Äôt want any of that in my house"},{"id":28,"name":"Kanata Shinkai","reason":"he‚Äôs always wet and that would ruin the wooden floors :|"},{"id":28,"name":"Kanata Shinkai","reason":"Would accidentally drown me"},{"id":28,"name":"Kanata Shinkai","reason":"I can't pay for the water bills unfortunately and I will not drive 10 km to go to the beach and stare at him floating in the sea \"girl help I'm drowning\" damn that's a you problem undrown yourself.

I am not here to say that Midori is unable to have a wonderful relationship/marriage, especially because some of the reasons I will be mentioning are things that I can relate to, and I am very happy in my current relationship. Mental illness does not mean somebody cannot date, but this is the least ready, not \"should not be in a relationship\"\nMidori has shown clear signs of mental illness throughout the story, even making it clear that they're suicidal. While this in of itself isn't a reason as many characters have been shown to experience mental health issues, it does lead us to show that their mental state isn't getting much better since they were first introduced.\nLet's use Leo for an example in the infamous story \"Checkmate\". Leo is shown to be extremely mentally unwell, going to extreme, unhealthy methods of coping, relying on Izumi for stability (and vice versa) and eventually, running away, leaving Izumi to believe he failed to \"protect\" him. As a result, Izumi tells himself he won't let this happen again and becomes obsessive over Makoto.\nWithin these examples however, it should be noted that the majority of the conflict that surrounded this has been handled. Makoto and Izumi are on good terms now, and Izumi and Leo have been working on moving on from their past. They work on it, want to work on it and their work shows.\nNow, when we take Midori however, there really isn't much that shows that they've been working on their current mental state, nor does it show that they plan on working on it. I don't know enough about their character to put the \"emotionally unavailable\" label on them, but it should be mentioned that as time goes on, this will only get worse. Mental illness isn't something that can go away within the blink of an eye, and a support system cannot fully replace therapy.\nOnce again, I am not here to say they cannot be in a relationship, nor is this all to Midori's character. However, out of this entire cast, I do believe that Midori being the least ready makes the most sense, at least in my mind."},{"id":5,"name":"Midori Takamine","reason":"Would be reeeally awkward"},{"id":5,"name":"Midori Takamine","reason":"He would not share his plushies"},{"id":5,"name":"Midori Takamine","reason":"I think he's mental health would rapidly decrease if he marries ANY enstarrie and I don‚Äôt want that for him.
