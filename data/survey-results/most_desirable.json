(HiMERU could never /j) She's caring and loving, and respects boundaries, and so freakin' honest and earnest in a relationship you never have to second guess what she says. You'd feel (and be) genuinely cared for and loved and isn't that enough??? ueueueue\nShe'd defend your honour with her life; she will fight anyone at a denny's parking lot who looks at her s/o even a smidge weirdge. She'd remember your birthday and throw you the biggest surprise party AND SHE SOMEHOW MANAGED TO CONTACT ALL YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS AND FAV IDOLS WITHOUT YOUR KNOWLEDGE.

After marriage it's so domestic and boring but you're still so disgustingly in love, that one day when you're both in your mid thirties or 60s (depends) you realise \"oh shit we're _that_ disgusting couple\" and when you point it out to her she just smiles at you all soft and warm and all the butterflies that settled a lil bit over the yrs suddenly all come back alive and \"holy moly i'm a full grown adult and yet i'm still acting like a school girl with a crush\"\n\nMy second runner up was Rinne Amagi but he teases ppl too much and I know that's not everyone's cup of tea (but I produce him so maybe that's why I'm biased hrk) He's very respectful too, but that moment you two get comfortable to the relationship he strikes. \n\n(Realise i typed up a whole essay, I'm sorry to u OP)"

And, as luck would have it, it would seem that I am presently here, readily capable to be the one to give him exactly what he needs through marriage. After an exciting, taxing day of doing his noble superhero idol work, I will be there, loyally waiting for him to come home to give him a nice massage and a delicious home-cooked meal. Upon noon, he will be brimming with joy at every lunch as he shall be free to boast amongst his peers that his partner had packed him a cute bento box for lunch, and upon opening his bento box, he shall uncover a gorgeous, exquisite bento lunch that I would have spent hours hunched-over, painstakingly crafting and planning the day prior to create the perfect bento lunch, food suitable for a hard-working man such as himself. Whenever he should have doubts or uncertainties over his convictions or his abilities, I will be there at his shoulder, to attentively listen to and sooth all of his woes. I will share with him simply what I know is the truth about him and this will be the motivation he needs to keep moving forward. And if ever should he find himself in the hospital again after some accident doing some STUPID, reckless superhero stunt, I will be there at his hospital bedside, waiting for him to open his eyes from slumber, watching the rise and fall of his chest as he breathes in peace, without a care in the world like a newborn babe, caressing the innocent serenity on his precious baby face. And then Eichi Tenshouin, my husband’s hospital roomie, will open his eyes in his hospital bed as he wakes from some frighteningly realistic, vivid nightmare, quickly patting himself down to make sure that he was safe. As he attempts to calm his racing heart, chanting to himself, “ it was only a dream, it was only a dream,” Eichi will suddenly freeze when finally feels another presence in the dimly lit hospital room, intensely watching not him, but something else. After gathering what little strength he has, Eichi will slowly turn over in his bed (which is good for him so that his sickly, bed-ridden body doesnt get bed sores after laying on the same side for so long) and a blood-curdling scream shall escape past eichi’s lips, further shortening the length of his meager lifespan, as he spies across the room, my haggard stature looming over my husband’s hospital bed, a figure with frazzled hair and bloodshot eyes as I will be patiently planning exactly how im going to reprimand my husband for making me worry about him as he had foolishly landed himself in the hospital once again. And that is why Chiaki Morisawa is the most desirable for marriage. And also, it would just be absolutely criminal of him to not pass on his gorgeous good looks and good nature onto the next generation, but I can only desperately pray that my evilness would not corrupt our beautiful children."

It wasn’t his illness that kept from his dream; not entirely. It was the people who built metal walls around what it meant to be an idol. How could a child with coughs of blood be able to climb these walls? If any say this could be done without mistake, I would call them a blaspheme. For they, who are weak minded could never understand this burning desire to reach happiness upon this earth. Do I think he’s an ideal husband for his riches? That is merely a part, his monetary riches are nothing in comparison to his riches within his mind."

    "id": 22,

    "reason": "Here's why Eichi Tenshouin is a Gold Digger's dream man:\n(Disclaimer: In the scout story Pretty Mission, Eichi says that it is inevitable he will marry someone chosen by his family for the benefit of the Tenshouin Zaibatsu. All arguments here are made under the assumption marrying Eichi allows one to take the “place” of a spouse deemed suitable by the Tenshouins).\n\n– Filthy rich; to the point I don’t think anyone would notice if tens-of-thousands of dollars went missing. You would never have to work another day in your life. Your entire family wouldn’t have to work another day in their lives. Is having that much wealth unethical? Yes. But you know what they say: if you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em. \n– Eichi would not give a fuck if you had extramarital affairs. As long as it doesn’t damage his reputation or the reputation of the Zaibatsu, its all good. Chances are he’s having them too. \n– As we are marrying for money, Eichi’s compromised life-span becomes a bonus. Putting up with Tenshouin expectations and drama might suck… for a while. The instant he dies take however much money you need and drop off the map. The collective grief of in-universe EichiPs will be so much that no one will notice you’re gone. \n– In Element, Eichi says that his mother “collects fighter jets” and “thinks she is the reincarnation of Marie Antionette”. I don’t know about everyone else but that sounds like someone I’d want to meet (and my personal first choice for extramarital affairs). \n– If you don’t think you can put up with Tenshouin family bullshit, marrying Eichi just to divorce him is also an option. The problem is you would need to (somehow) make sure he marries you without signing a prenup. Considering how much Eichi loves his contracts, I’m not sure how one would go about this. But then again, if you manage to marry Eichi Tenshouin I’m sure you could manipulate the prenup situation to your liking\n– Being Eichi’s spouse means you'd get at least some amount of media-attention. However, it would be possible to lead a very private life if you wanted to. Since the Tenshouins employ people to do all their chores for them, you could just chill in the mansion all day and not have to worry about running errands.\n– On the other hand, you could just as easily watch the world burn. Say the wildest most inappropriate things to the media, get into fights with Eichi stans on twitter, take down the Tenshouins from the inside - the possibilities are endless. \n\n(I apologise for writing so much I've had this on my mind for years)"

I believe that he would be committed to his marriage and would protect his spouse and make them feel incredibly safe, and would be receptive to feedback and talking things out with his spouse to make them happy. \n(I don't know too much about his experiences as a cult member, but I'd posit from what I do know that it'd encourage him to be more patient with his spouse in terms of understanding or communication because he has a better grasp of 'other perspectives'.)\nAlso, I am biased.

(was gonna say his workaholic tendencies but no actually, because he'd probably listen if his wife/husband tells him to take care of himself more) Ritsu Sakuma. Like, if you want to marry Mao, you'd better be prepared to share him with the dude who's obsessed with him (which, Mao would probably not mind btw ಠ⁠_⁠ಠ)."

    "id": 18,
    "name": "Mao Isara",
    "reason": "First of all, Mao was in a shuffle where the concept was about marriage (Ring.A.Bell haters dni I will die with their song) and he did AMAZING have you guys listened to his vocals???? He does amazing in love songs omg Finder Girl was EVERYTHING.\nAnother reason is the fact that he's clearly a responsible/mature person, yet he manages to have his moments of immaturity and let's himself go around those he cares about. He may believe that there's \"nothing special\" about him, but the thing with falling in love is that this person is special, even if others don't see. From my time in the fandom, I think this is how people who love Mao tend to act towards him. Sure, he may not have some super interesting past, but you find things about him and grow to love him for that.\nOf course, there are things that should be mentioned, which are his insecurities and how it's manifested into jealousy. I myself am a huge ritsumao shipper, yet I find it weird that people have used Mao's jealousy toward Ritsu growing closer to others as a way to push the ship, when in reality it's most likely due to his insecurities. I can speak from experience when I say this, but when he saw Ritsu hanging out with others, he felt jealous not because of the jealousy we see in fanfics but because his mind goes to the possibility of abandonment. That Ritsu is going to start seeing Mao the way he sees himself - somebody who's boring and uninteresting - and leave him for others. \nNow, we can't just look at this and say that he can't be in a romantic relationship. Mao, at least from the stories I've read with him in it, doesn't really show signs of being emotionally unavailable. He cares for those he loves and while he does have many things he needs to work on, it's no doubt that he's very responsible and, if he desired, would be ready for a relationship. Especially when we put him in a non-idol setting where he won't get harassed for dating someone."

    "name": "Mao Isara",
    "reason": "Ok I would've chosen Kaname because he's my current oshi but Mao was my second (the Natsume oshi arc was short lived) and Kaname has a lot of issues he has to work through before he could even consider being in a relationship in the first place (ignoring that he's currently in a coma). I honestly haven't read that much of the actual story but hear me out. Mao has already been shown to be a caring person (taking care of Ritsu and Trickstar) and he would absolutely do anything for someone he loves. He's also very cautious, as evidenced by the scene where him and Makoto tell Anzu not to stay overnight in the same room as them, as it'll seem strange and offers to walk her home instead (among other scenes). This demonstrates how he's very careful with boundaries, which is already a good quality to have as a boyfriend. Along with that, I personally think he'd be the type to do anything for whoever he loves, and disregard what he wants so he can make them happy (I guess he does do this a lot, he doesn't really think about his feelings, only how the rest of Trickstar feels unless he's forced to). I feel as if he'd also be a very loving person and be very affectionate with his lover (after he stops being worried and awkward). Of course Mao does have his issues, especially with communicating how he feels about things. As evidenced by his experience with Nagisa, he doesn't have very high self esteem, nor is he very willing to talk about his feelings. This could cause issues in a relationship and cause him to feel unloved, inadequate, or unheard, while also being completely aware that it's his fault he feels like he can't talk about things. Again, this ties into how he wants to see his loved ones happy... He doesn't want to burden anyone with how he feels, probably in part due to his lack of self esteem as well. Of course, after this issue is taken care of, he'd definitely be a lot happier in a relationship, which is ultimately what we want.\nOf course, I'm probably wrong about a lot of this (I don't know his full crimes against humanity list, which most Enstars characters have), but from what I've seen with his interactions with Anzu, he definitely seems to be the type of person you'd want to be in a relationship with, being that he's very caring and loving once shown that it's ok for him to be as such."

Intrusive thoughts are well, intrusive and something in your mind you'd never want to act on or think about. Mayoi's urge to be a role model to younger members of ALKALOID and other members in other groups tends to be corrupted by his impure thoughts causing him to look down on himself but best believe he's trying 🙏🏽. In his wiki, Mayoi is described to be \"skittish and reclusive\" which wouldn't go well because if you're trying to have a big marriage with your family and friends invited, he'd pass out before he could put a ring on your finger but, he can never turn his back on someone in need. Especially someone he loves like in the beginning of the !! Main Story in the first chapter, Mayoi gets over his fear of large crowds to help the other underachievers into safety. Because he loves you, you two could have the biggest wedding in all of mankind and he'd find himself able to kiss you at that alter. He's also a very observant person often picking up on subtle changes so, of course he's be well in tune to your emotions and because he's a loyal, caring person he'd do any and everything he can to make you feel better. You're feeling a little sad? Mayoi's already at your side asking you what's wrong. How'd he know?? Your sigh had a bit more carbon dioxide than when you're happy. On top of being observant he's literally a genius?? He's shown to master things with little to no instruction so, need help with anything? Mayoi's got it and could explain it better than a college professor with 20 years of research. Obviously, Mayoi is very self-deprecating, seeing himself as sub-human and you could see this as a major problem in marriage but, I believe before you and Mayoi get married you two would have to be together for years before he pops the question, in those years you would show him that he's worth it and that you love him for who he is and he doesn't want to push you away so he'd try his best to work on himself and get better. I believe Mayoi is a 10/10 husband who'd devote his all to you. I need this man 😭🙏🏽"
