# Data to Analyze
- **Hall of Fame:** List all of the characters by how popular they are
    - A timeline format except it's not a timeline
- **Popular Vote:** Filterable graph that lets people view how popular a character is vs. how popular they're perceived to be
    - Ask the user who they voted for as most popular
- **Highs and Lows:** Show how popular each character in a unit is compared to the unit itself
    - Example: Madara is quite popular but MaM is wildly unpopular
- **Power of Friendship:** Stack the votes for each character in a unit on top of each other to see which unit has the most popular characters overall, also compare it to how many votes the actual unit got
    - Note that this might favor units with more members (looks at Ryuseitai and Valkyrie) but that might not be a problem
- **Badge of Honor:** A bonus page for users to share which character they chose as their favorite
    - Let users input their username to search for their vote
    - If they didn't vote, then they can share who they wish they voted for
