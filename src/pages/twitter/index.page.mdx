# about me (twitter edition)

hi! this basically acts as a byf/dni page

message me on [retrospring](https://retrospring.net/@hellogirls)!

### basic info
- 24 years old
- black & queer
- [i really like javascript](https://hellogirls.info/projects)

### enstars info

- EN player (started playing 6/2022)
- **fave charas:** niki, *mayoi, tomoya, rinne, makoto, noritama*
- **fave units:** crazy:b, *ra\*bits, ryuseitai*
- **fave ships (order does not matter):** rinniki, kohaai

### general account info

- crazy:b is my favorite unit i love them a lot so i'll retweet anything i see of them!
- i softblock to unfollow, it's hardly ever personal when i do softblock and i don't mind if you refollow i just softblock out of courtesy
- notifs are off for non-mutuals... sorry i get overwhelmed easily... if you ever want me to see a post feel free to dm it to me! 
- i'm very shy and don't know how to respond to replies a lot of the time T__T i'll always like replies that i see in order to say haiiiiii :3
- i delete tweets often just cause i don't want my account to get too crowded

### rules 

- **do not interact if you think racism/colorism isn't a big deal, think of racism/colorism as solely a "western" issue, undermine/harass those who call out the racism in enstars/the fandom, or prioritize the feelings of fictional characters over real poc. i want nothing to do with you and nothing i make will ever be for you.**
- im not proship/profic and have to ask ppl who consume problematic content to not interact, im very uncomfortable with the content promoted by profiction. i don't identify as an anti or harass people over this i just block and move on.
- i tend to block/mute those who **harass people over their *harmless* enstars opinions** (ex. insulting/qrting people who don't like your favorite characters/units/songs) it's immature and annoying
- i do use blockchains so if you don't fall under any of the above and are blocked pls feel free to lemme know i'll most likely unblock!!
- **Involve me in discourse and it'll be the last thing you do.**

thats all, ty for reading!!
