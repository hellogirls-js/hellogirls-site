# about me (twitter edition)

hi! this basically acts as a byf/dni page

### enstars info

- EN player (started playing 6/2022) (engstarrie /neg)
- **fave charas:** *niki*, mayoi, tomoya, rinne, makoto, ryusei jrs
- **fave units:** crazy:b, ra\*bits, ryuseitai
- **fave ships (order does not matter):** rinniki, rinhime, hiiteto, kohaai, platonic nikimayo

### general account info

- i have lots of gender/sexuality headcanons, feel free to ask me about them!
- i'm actually fine with character hate LOL you can follow if you don't like my faves (i might complain abt mischaracterizations tho)
- i'm very shy and don't know how to respond to replies sometimes T__T i'll always like replies that i see in order to say haiiiiii :3

### rules 

- im black and being a minority where im from impacts how i view enstars stories, so i have a low tolerance for people who are uncritical of the racist aspects of enstars/media in general or shut down poc who bring it up
- im not proship/profic and have to ask ppl who are proship/profic to not interact, the content makes me extremely uncomfortable. i will never take part in harassment over this tho since i'd much rather avoid this discourse all together
- if i have you blocked its either because you fall under these 2 categories, follow people who do, or for another silly reason. you can [ask me](https://curiouscat.live/hellogirlsqa) to unblock since there's an 80% chance i don't even remember blocking you ^__^;; (i'm kinda pea-brained sorry)
- i kindly have to ask public nsfw accounts to not interact with me :( private nsfw accounts are fine!

thats all, ty for reading!!
