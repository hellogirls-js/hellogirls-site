# about me (twitter edition)

hi! this basically acts as a byf/dni page

message me on [retrospring](https://retrospring.net/@hellogirls)!

### basic info
- {dayjs().diff(dayjs(props.birthday), "year")} years old
- black & queer
- [i really like javascript](https://twitter.com/hellogirls_DEV)

### enstars info

- EN player (started playing 6/2022)
- i produce **niki**!!!!!!
- other characters i like include the rest of crazy:b, mayoi, tomoya, and tetora
- in terms of ships i am a nikirin(niki) enjoyer i retweet it a lot! 

### general account info

- i softblock to unfollow, it's hardly ever personal when i do softblock and i don't mind if you refollow i just softblock out of courtesy. i'd appreciate it if mutuals could softblock to unfollow me as well
- notifs are on for followers only
- i'm very shy and don't know how to respond to replies a lot of the time T__T i'll always like replies that i see in order to say haiiiiii :3
- i often post about how i produce the cutest character in ensemble stars which may be controversial... you have been warned...

### rules 

- **please don't ask me for coding help unless i explicitly offer.** this is something that takes a lot of time that i can't offer to people :( thank you for understanding!!
- **do not interact if you think racism/colorism isn't a big deal, undermine/harass those who call out racism either in enstars or the fandom, or prioritize the feelings of fictional characters over real poc. i want nothing to do with you and nothing i make will ever be for you.**
- im not proship/profic and im very uncomfortable with the content promoted by profiction. i don't identify as an anti and will never harass anyone over this, i just block and move on
- i tend to block/mute those who often get into arguments or can't handle other people's harmless enstars opinions
- if you're blocked and don't fall under the categories above feel free to shoot me a message and i can unblock! i'm tryna clear out my block list
- **Involve me in discourse and it'll be the last thing you do.**

thats all, ty for reading!!
