# about me (twitter edition)

hi! this basically acts as a byf/dni page

### enstars info

- EN player (started playing 6/2022) (engstarrie /neg)

- **fave units:** crazy:b, ra\*bits, ryuseitai

### general account info

- i have lots of gender/sexuality headcanons, feel free to ask me about them!
- i'm actually fine with character hate LOL you can follow if you don't like my faves
- i'm very shy and don't know how to respond to replies sometimes T__T i'll always like replies that i see in order to say haiiiiii :3

### rules 

- im black and being a minority where im from impacts how i view enstars stories, so i have a low tolerance for people who are uncritical of the racist aspects of enstars/media in general or shut down poc who bring it up. therefore, i don't feel comfortable interacting with people who were called out for racism, especially as an adult.
- im not proship/profic and have to ask ppl who are proship/profic to not interact, im very uncomfortable with the content promoted by profiction. however, i dont identify as an anti and will never harass people over this since i want to avoid seeing this content as much as possible.
- if i have you blocked its either because you fall under these 2 categories, follow people who do, or have personally annoyed me. sometimes i unblock if i come across u and don't remember blocking you, but otherwise if you're blocked it's probably for a good reason.
- i kindly have to ask public nsfw accounts to not interact with me :( private nsfw accounts are fine!

thats all, ty for reading!!
