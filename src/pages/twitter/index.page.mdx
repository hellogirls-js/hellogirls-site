# about me (twitter edition)

hi! this basically acts as a byf/dni page

### basic info
- 24 yrs old
- black
- queer; don't ask me to elaborate further on this (she/he preference; they = OK!)

### enstars info

- EN player (started playing 6/2022) (engstarrie /neg)
- **fave charas:** niki, *mayoi, tomoya, rinne, makoto, ryuseilings*
- **fave units:** crazy:b, *ra\*bits, ryuseitai*
- **fave ships (order does not matter):** rinniki, rinhime, hiiteto, kohaai, platonic nikimayo

### general account info

- crazy:b is my favorite unit i love them a lot so i'll retweet anything i see of them!
- i tend to use non-canon pronouns for characters
- i'm actually fine with character hate LOL you can follow if you don't like my faves
- i'm very shy and don't know how to respond to replies a lot of the time T__T i'll always like replies that i see in order to say haiiiiii :3
- i'm *very* annoying. you have been warned.

### rules 

- im black and being a minority where im from impacts how i view enstars stories, so i have a low tolerance for people who are uncritical of the racist aspects of enstars/media in general or shut down poc who bring it up. therefore, i don't feel comfortable interacting with people who were called out for racism, especially as an adult.
- im not proship/profic and have to ask ppl who are proship/profic to not interact, im very uncomfortable with the content promoted by profiction. however, i dont identify as an anti and will never harass people over this since i want to avoid seeing this content as much as possible. i just block and move on ^^
- i kindly have to ask public nsfw accounts to not interact with me :( private nsfw accounts are fine!
- engaging in lgbt discourse = block/mute
- i block *very* liberally and tend to go on blocking sprees, if you don't fall under any of the above and are blocked pls feel free to lemme know i'll most likely unblock!!

thats all, ty for reading!!
