# about me (twitter edition)

hi! this basically acts as a byf/dni page

message me on [retrospring](https://retrospring.net/@hellogirls)!

### basic info
- {dayjs().diff(dayjs(props.birthday), "year")} years old
- black & queer
- [i really like javascript](https://hellogirls.info/projects)

### enstars info

- EN player (started playing 6/2022)
- **fave charas:** **niki**, mayoi, tomoya, rinne, makoto, noritama
- **fave units:** **crazy:b**, ra\*bits, ryuseitai
- **fave ships (order does not matter):** rinniki, kohaai

### general account info

- crazy:b is my favorite unit i love them a lot so i'll retweet anything i see of them!
- i softblock to unfollow, it's hardly ever personal when i do softblock and i don't mind if you refollow i just softblock out of courtesy
- notifs are off for non-mutuals... sorry i get overwhelmed easily... if you ever want me to see a post feel free to dm it to me! 
- i'm very shy and don't know how to respond to replies a lot of the time T__T i'll always like replies that i see in order to say haiiiiii :3
- i delete tweets often just cause i don't want my account to get too crowded

### rules 

- **do not interact if you think racism/colorism isn't a big deal, undermine/harass those who call out racism either in enstars or the fandom, or prioritize the feelings of fictional characters over real poc. i want nothing to do with you and nothing i make will ever be for you.**
- im not proship/profic and have to ask ppl who consume problematic content to not interact, im very uncomfortable with the content promoted by profiction. i don't identify as an anti though and will never harass anyone over this, i just block and move on. please respect this boundary and don't villainize me for it
- i tend to block/mute those who **harass people over their *harmless* enstars opinions** (ex. insulting/qrting people who don't like your favorite characters/units/songs) it's immature and annoying
- **Involve me in discourse and it'll be the last thing you do.**

thats all, ty for reading!!
