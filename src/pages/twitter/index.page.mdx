- **do not interact if you think racism/colorism isn't a big deal, undermine/harass those who call out racism either in enstars or the fandom, or prioritize the feelings of fictional characters over real poc. i want nothing to do with you and nothing i make will ever be for you.**
- also don't interact if you're against self shipping or think it's "cringe"
- i'm not proship/profic and **i don't identify as an anti and will never harass anyone over this**, i just block and move on
- i tend to block/mute those who often get into arguments or are aggressive about defending characters
- if you're blocked and don't fall under the categories above feel free to shoot me a message and i can unblock! i'm tryna clear out my block list
- **Involve me in discourse and it'll be the last thing you do.**
