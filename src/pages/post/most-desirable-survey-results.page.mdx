# it's here--! the ensemble stars characters that are most desirable for marriage!

<CardCG src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/ensemble-stars/images/c/ce/%28Heartfelt_Bouquet%29_Mao_Isara_CG2.png" alt="blessed ring.a.bell mao isara" />

hello! i conducted a survey on twitter asking ensemble stars fans who they believe to be the most and least desirable for marriage. this was inspired by a survey conducted in among the korean fanbase. the survey i did received almost **1000** responses, and i'm excited to share the results with you all!

here's how the survey worked:

- i asked responders to choose only **one** character for most and least desirable each. this is because i wanted people to think about who they were choosing and provide a thoughtful (yet hilarious) response.
- for the most desirable section, i limited the character options to those that are 3rd years or older.
- i kept the survey open for a week, as i was told that if i kept it open for any longer it might lose traction.

so, with that listed out, let's get started, shall we?

## 38TH PLACE -- KANAME TOJO (2 votes)

> with our combined mental issues we could kill so many people together and it would be wonderful and freeing for both of us. the first target is his brother

> idk i just really like kaname. i think he is a silly specimen

## 38TH PLACE #2 -- KOGA OOGAMI (2 votes)

> I'm a furry, Gray hair aggressive ahh but is actually very caring to their loved one (gets me everytime), Probs stinky ahh hair but I still choose believe it's soft and is begging me to pat his hair, GIVE ME MORE BANGERS PLS, Literally will take care of my kids (I'm gay), His determination and will to never give up nor let anyone he cares for give up is such a distinctive trait that's fitting for his alpha wolf era

> he can cook, he can clean, he’s frugal, he grows his own vegetables, he’s cute, he might complain about it but he will look after you, and he has a dog. perfect wife material

(sorry koga u deserve more) - from the council

## 36TH PLACE -- JIN SAGAMI (3 votes)

> funny old man he’s my wifeguy we’re t4t

## 36TH PLACE #2 -- RITSU SAKUMA (3 votes)

> more of a personal thing i think our personalities could i guess work out the best i’d kill everyone

> ok look i have insomnia but i guarantee i will be cured of that shit having ritsu as a husband. he’s practically a walking body pillow, who WOULDNT want to cuddle up to that man. i bet he’s warm too. also he’s cute. its like having a pet koala but not a koala and significantly more ethical. also i think he’s like a malewife i dont even remember OH YEAH HE BAKES. THE MALEWIFE EVER

> My parents never allowed me to own a cat... So marriying one should be the best case scenario

## 34TH PLACE -- HIYORI TOMOE (4 votes)

> i can and will cook and make drinks for him (i’m better than jun in that)

> Hiyori experienced the Tomoe foundation going down and starting back again in Reimei before climbing the ladders back up again. Therefore, I believe this experience greatly encompasses the marriage vow, "in richer or poorer". (please send help I am crying as I bullsh*t this) Also, he can shower you with gifts, if that's your thing. He is also a great listener, even though he may say things vaguely and hard to understand but you have to know that he means well. He values the people he loves so much and what more if it's his betrothed? And in this essay I will

> Call me old fashioned but I was raised to be able to serve my wife Hiyori. I can clean the dishes and cook him food. I will do whatever he says because I want him to be my wife and he can make the rules around the house.

> absolutely no jokes here i just like green men with purple eyes

## 33RD PLACE -- AKIOMI KUNUGI (5 votes)

> Listen. He is 30 and a fucking high school teacher and still looks like a twink. Yes he used to be a model but some of them age horribly like did you see Harry Styles for example. Everything aside I met many teachers and other guys his age and he is a very cutesy case of a 30 year old.

> He would smile like one of those manhwa male Leads that were cold but are super warm to the person they love and it makes people go KYAAAA which is exactly why I want him also I feel like he'd be caring even if he doesn't have time to always to tend to my needs

> Truly I am infatuated with Akiomi, such an amazing man he is. If I were to marry any Enstar it would he him not only due to the fact that his personality goes well with mine and that he seems very enjoyable to be around. Totally not for any other reason such as the fact that I absolutely love older men. Akiomi would treat me well and I believe wholeheartedly that we would last a lifetime together.
> 
> tldr; old men sexy i love akiomi 

> See I KNOW it would be funnier if I chose a main cast member but this man is like. The sanest and one of the few middle aged character so. He's shown to be great w kids in the flashback card but I would have to get past Jin and Arashi's judgement too (jokingly, I see him as a mentor to Ara!). We would build a glasses collection together lol

## 32ND PLACE #1 -- NATSUME SAKASAKI (7 votes)

> i didnt choose him the autism did

> I want to put him in a jar and study him

> Because ik he deeply cares for someone he loves, i fell in love w/ him the first time i saw him in the login screen when i first played and i fell even harder after reading lots of stories abt him. I love the way he cares for sora in magic lantern 😭💘

> he'd curse my enemies :)

> natsume and i would be a top–notch neurodivergent duo, completely and wholly UNMATCHED 🔥 i could look at his beautiful citrine orbs all day if i didn't have an issue with eye contact! i think magicians are very cool as well, if he pulled a coin from behind my ear i'd instantly be head over heels for him (i'm a simple person)

## 32ND PLACE #2 -- NAGISA RAN (7 votes)

> i would listen to him tell me about rocks forever and then he would listen to me tell him about city planning. i think it would be very fulfilling for both of us.

> If we were ever to go bankrupt, His collection of rocks will keep us entertained and enrichened (although the latter, mayhaps, only morally)

> How to say this huh....
This is the first time I found someone that similar to me, and I can understand his character clearly.
He behave like grandpa, but his understanding about this world is like a child. He's innocent, and yet he can scheming something behind you. He won't hurt you a lil bit, but will torture you with his mischievousness. He's so contradict to himself. But, that's what makes him unique for me.
He likes to be taken care of and taking care someone. He can be clingy but he will protect you from any harm possible. He wants to dominate the world, but he doesn't even can make lunch by himself. He need someone to guide him, yet he's guiding someone who guide him.
He's silly, but hey, that 's ok.  He's so positive and charming but intimidating.
I think I can type more than this just like him monologuing on his dialogue.
He's a special person to me, really. I was in my lowest state and suddenly I remembered about game that called "Ensemble Stars".
I scout coz I just wanted pretty card, and he came home. I got stunned by his FS really. It's so.... Beautiful. I started to reading his story and I was like, "Ah.... Finally I have someone who I can relate to."
I cried when he can't understand but still trying his best to understanding human's emotions. He wants the best for them. He wants them to be happy and smile like him.
He's such an awesome guy that I will and wont hestitate to married to.
I apologize for writing a whole essay here really.... But people need to admire his character writing. He's more than "A silly guy that wants to be a god" or "That one handsome and beautiful man".
I want everyone to love him like how I love him. He's a precious person to me that I will embrace for the rest of my life because his character growth is exceptional.*

*(son note: this is so cute T^T)

> I feel like he'd be such a kind and gentle person to be around. His partner might need to patiently teach him how real world works like but he's already gotten the hang of most things so I'm sure he'll be fine!

## 32ND PLACE #3 -- KANATA SHINKAI (7 votes)

> silly autism fish girl :) 	[I am ignoring how much our water bill would be]

> :3

> Because he's the sweetest little guy, If Kanata ever got married, he'd say he's the happiest man alive the cutest way possible, you'd wed at the beach and after the wedding he'd probably carry you home and talk about fishes, I like that in a man

> even though he might try to drown me its fine because i love him. i can do the cooking, cleaning, everything

> i would easily agree to spend the entire day everyday under water and am easily amused by aquatic creatures (would not get tired of watching them moving around in aquariums)

> water:)

## 32ND PLACE #4 -- MAKOTO YUUKI (7 votes)

> I want to have a Gamer husband

> If I saw makoto's sweet smile and cute glasses I could not have a bad day. If he was my husband I would be motivated to do anything. That damn hamster.

> hes so silly i want to pinch his cheek and make him cookies like a grandma

> i’m a support main. we would be a good duo ♥

> even tho he s like a redditor [REDACTED] i feel like makoto is kind of the only normal guy

> i want to borrow his gaming setup indefinitely

## 28TH PLACE #1 -- LEO TSUKINAGA (8 votes)

> he's just the sweetest guy he'd go UCHUUU WAHAHA at the wedding

> IM ALSO AUTISTIC WE CAN DO IT TOGETHER BOY

> He look mature enough and i can see him being picky about the wedding, honey moon and pre wedding photoshoot

> honestly no one in enstars is suitable for marriage i just want leo romantically

> Because he would write his wedding song and I think he’d be the sweetest ever, like marriage proposal through a serenade composed and played by him kind of sweet! He’s also extremely loyal! He and Izumi have been married for years!

## 28TH PLACE #2 -- HiMERU (8 votes)

<CardCG src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/ensemble-stars/images/3/36/%28Bitter_Remarks%29_HiMERU_CG2.png" alt="himeru" caption="(son note: i desire him. badly)" />

> He looks like a divorced single mother and god am I ready to be his next spouse

> I would go up to him and say "good lird you're sexy" (son note: girl me too)

> pheromones

> I was going to vote for Rinne but I think I'm more attracted to losers.

> if i'm married to him that would mean he does indeed trust me right? it's okay if he ends up still talking in third person he's sexy. we would be able to manage taxes together, good coffee in morning. POV alone time with HiMERU, he drops the third person talk and speaks normally. *Hottest thing on earth i'm dead*

> hes really good at pretending to be kaname so im sure hed be great at pretending to love me back

## 26TH PLACE -- HOKUTO HIDAKA (10 votes)

> I believe that he not only would do his best out of duty but also that he would be very intertaining to be married to. I would ask him to bring me my pillow and he would bring a pillow with me on it. Top tier man. 10/10 i would love to marry him.

> my princess... so silly. she would be a gentleman and so  mip. i can't think of real reason just trust me

> if i marry hokuto and hokutos mom shows up to the wedding maybe i can seduce her (i just know the hidaka genes are good)

> His autistic personality and transgender looks have captivated me. His parents are fucking loaded. He would beat the shit out of anybody that crossed me. My girl looks so good today I'm gonna scream and moan and throw up. I worship the ground he walks on. He tells me to shut up and I do. Our autism is compatible. I understand his gender. Every time he repeats something his grandma told him I run my finger down his chest and tell him to tell me more. I help him do his crossword puzzles. He looks like a kitty cat. He Acts like a kitty cat. He's quite silly. He's everything I could have ever wanted and more. (son note: hi talek)

## 25TH PLACE -- REI SAKUMA (11 votes)

> get yourself a man that all he does is be pretty because he sleeps all day in that coffin fr. and also if you marry him, you'll automatically have a dog (koga). did i mention hes pretty?

> idk he looks like he would tell me Ohh mine bloomed tulip.. How mesmerizing thy expression is.. and then just drop his whole act for the rest of the day

> he's gay, i'm lesbian, we'd marry for the tax benefits.

> even tho he's not my produce I think it's Rei Sakuma from the unit UNDEAD of the hit rhythm game Ensemble Stars!! Music. I mean, the way he cares for his subordinates, calling them *his children*, supporting everyone's back? uhm HELLO WAKE UP. His only downside is being asleep at morning but to some extent HE WILL WAKE UP IN THE MORNING JUST FOR SOMETHING SPECIAL. If that ain't so husbandy then idk what it is

> rei

## 24TH PLACE -- MIKA KAGEHIRA (12 votes)

> Mika, can cook (i think) can clean (probably not) has a beautifle smile, hes adorable, hes tiny, hes just amazing in every aspect you can think of. i love mika. shu is a lucky man and should cherish mika more (even though he already does). he should wake up and thank god for mika, mika is a devoted and loyal man, he would never betray you on purpose. god bless the mika

> He seems good with children and if he can handle Itsuki, he can handle any human being on earth.

> he

> people say marrying shu will guarantee you a wedding dress but they probably forget that mika will also guarantee you a wedding ring

> He seems good with children and if he can handle Itsuki, he can handle any human being on earth.

## 23RD PLACE -- SEIYA HIDAKA (13 votes)

> He is literally a married. A DILF too, might I add

> hokuto can never have too many dads

> ah yes, someone that is married is the most suitable for marriage.

> need my babies to have that hidaka genes

> He's already a popular idol and plus the hidaka family is so pretty...I'd marry him

## 22ND PLACE -- MAYOI AYASE (14 votes)

<CardCG src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/ensemble-stars/images/f/f7/%28Coward%27s_Dead_End%29_Mayoi_Ayase_CG.png" alt="mayoi ayase" caption="my girl is so adorable" />

> it's like having a cat, if you hear scary weird things in the night you can just go "oh its okay, my wife is doing Something ♥" and go back to sleep feeling safe and comforted

> She will be a great mother to our 10 cats

> He cooks and cleans, he's like Yuzuru without the pent-up rage. I want to hold his hand and drive him to therapy

> feel like we’d get along well idk thats just my babygirl

> Mayoi deserves to know that he is worthy of love and honestly I feel this is the best way to show him

> Mayoi makes me feel safe. He will be obsessed with me. He doesn’t have a choice 💖. Mayoi also probably has a killer skin care routine and hair routine so I gotta know it. 

> While I'm aware Mayoi is seen as strange upon first glance and yeah, he is strange 💀 In the stories once you get to know him his goal to protect others and be someone to rely on outweighs his intrusive thoughts making him appear like someone dangerous. Intrusive thoughts are well, intrusive and something in your mind you'd never want to act on or think about. Mayoi's urge to be a role model to younger members of ALKALOID and other members in other groups tends to be corrupted by his impure thoughts causing him to look down on himself but best believe he's trying 🙏🏽. In his wiki, Mayoi is described to be "skittish and reclusive" which wouldn't go well because if you're trying to have a big marriage with your family and friends invited, he'd pass out before he could put a ring on your finger but, he can never turn his back on someone in need. Especially someone he loves like in the beginning of the !! Main Story in the first chapter, Mayoi gets over his fear of large crowds to help the other underachievers into safety. Because he loves you, you two could have the biggest wedding in all of mankind and he'd find himself able to kiss you at that alter. He's also a very observant person often picking up on subtle changes so, of course he's be well in tune to your emotions and because he's a loyal, caring person he'd do any and everything he can to make you feel better. You're feeling a little sad? Mayoi's already at your side asking you what's wrong. How'd he know?? Your sigh had a bit more carbon dioxide than when you're happy. On top of being observant he's literally a genius?? He's shown to master things with little to no instruction so, need help with anything? Mayoi's got it and could explain it better than a college professor with 20 years of research. Obviously, Mayoi is very self-deprecating, seeing himself as sub-human and you could see this as a major problem in marriage but, I believe before you and Mayoi get married you two would have to be together for years before he pops the question, in those years you would show him that he's worth it and that you love him for who he is and he doesn't want to push you away so he'd try his best to work on himself and get better. I believe Mayoi is a 10/10 husband who'd devote his all to you. I need this man 😭🙏🏽

## 21ST PLACE -- WATARU HIBIKI (15 votes)

> long hair is so fucking hot

> he can do it all !!! funny, charming, can pull doves out of his sleeves or something IDK HES THE PERFECT HUSBAND !!!

> pros: watarus the type of guy who follows u around to make sure ur entertained. writes u poetry. strews rose petals on the floor u walk on. cooks . got the looks. i think hes 5'9? good lord im not even into men but dayumn🙏, cons: as married as a gacha character can be sorry ladies and gentlemen

> every day, i could play with watarus soft and beautiful long hair and do pretty braids and adorn it with flowers, and next time law enforcement comes for me, i can easily hide among his silky locks and no one will suspect a thing

> Man literally broke into a hospital to wish Eichi a Merry Christmas while in a Santa costume, that sort of dedication to one's lover is something I need 🥺 *(son note: apparently this only happened in eichi's dreams and wataru didn't actually do this, still cute tho)*

## 20TH PLACE #1 -- IZUMI SENA (16 votes)

> I have a thing for mentally ill women

> a walking kdrama rich green flag male lead *(son note: ?)*

> i want him

> I volunteer to be his pet

> i need someone to take care of me im lonely im at mylowest point

> hear me out izumi is actually so wife... does anyone else see it... she's a bitch but she's also very loving and caring and she actually goes out of her way to look after others quite a lot even while saying mean stuff to them and she's good with cooking and she LOVES HUGS!!! that's very important and she's very pretty. and her being fucked up in the head actually makes everything better. Wife.

> Izumi can do anything the other housewife-y characters can do and he gets all that on top of being the most beautiful character in this game and u might say “but u have to deal with his personality” no. HE has to deal with MINE.

> Im already in love with sick twisted and kind personality

> I know this might seem questionable but— this guy can cook well. He takes care of himself well. He dresses well. He’s hardworking and responsible. He might come off as a nagging mom but he cares a lot about your well being. He’s self aware. He’s helpful (not without nagging first, but still). He has a stable job. Honestly, he’s an overall good choice lol.  

## 20TH PLACE #2 -- SOUMA KANZAKI (16 votes)

> he has long and very beautiful hair and he would be a beautiful wife for me and my children

> [Strong. Looks nice with fish](https://stars.ensemble.moe/cards/2159)

> soumer

> his autistic personality and transgender looks have captivated me

> he’s just a guy. i think my family would approve him minus his habit of bringing a sword everywhere! also i can’t cook

> I want to be Adonis-dono

> I want to braid his hair

> Sword, turtle, looks like a girl, what else do you want?

> He's just so beautiful and amazing and he can cook so obviously I would sacrifice my life for him I mean, who wouldn't?!?!

> Souma is perfect wife material. He is a bomb cook, he’s super sweet, likes cats, very dedicated, and I would never be in danger again. Also, he’s beautiful and I love him. 

> Love a guy who is so sincere and will say things to your face. Can't have any better communication and a nice face with long hair.

## 18TH PLACE -- JUN SAZANAMI (17 votes)

> just a normalguy168 and i think u get the whole of eden as like a package deal and u cld just vibe, but there’s also the risk that u fail the vibe check and ibara thinks u are a threat to cospro. maybe the best solution is to just be mary since you get loved by eden and you can also terrify yuzuru. thank u for listening.

> He has the common sense that I lack and I want him to talk to me the way he talks to Hiyori's dog ♡

> hes my boinky spunge my crinklo doo my cutesit tootsit my eeby deeby

> jun is the most "he's just some guy" ever which makes him the most ideal malewife out of everyone. let me explain- he is such a Himbo that if u manage to make him fall for u then he is gonna follow you forever and simp every morning. he's gonna wake up and look at u and giggle, curl toes and cover his face like "good morning ♡♡♡♡♡" and then zone out with a smile when u kiss him even tho you've been married for 20 years and kissed everyday. thank you hiyori tomoe for dragging him around since that makes me think this guy knows how to keep a room clean at least (knowing doesn't equal doing but its ok!! i can fix him!!) and he would do Everything he possibly can to learn how to make ur favorite dish only to get praise for it. he's 100% simp boyfriend. he is a personal cheerleader, gushes about u to everyone he meets, blushes even after years of marriage and is happy by the most basic simplest of attention too. you call him handsome casually before work and he's gonna think abt it all day, looking into the mirror and remembering the words and then smiling to himself. you give him a kiss on the cheek and he puts his hand over it for a solid minjte....... he is so babygirl u dont understand i dont have words to say it. im writing thru my tears just thinking sbt how malewife babygirl she is rn

> he's normal by enstars standard can cook can clean can dance can sing can work

> He is literally malewife and i think one of the sanest character. I just thought he wouldn't give me second hand embarrassment. Im holding myself not to put Niki cuz im biased but he'll probably be more focused on the food instead on the marriage 😭

> he is boyfriend material. like. look at how he treats hiyori. that is boyfriend material. bro cooks for him, wakes him up daily, literally treats him like a princess WHAT MORE CAN I ASK FOR 

> i am actually married to jun and he takes very good care of me

> I was tempted to choose my favorite but he felt more.. normal..

> jun can deal with hiyori :3 that means he can deal with me :3 mwah mwah i love u jun

## 17TH PLACE -- TSUMUGI AOBA (19 votes)


> I want a pathetic man that goes kyaaaaa!!! "{">"}_{"<"}"

> he would trip over his feet running to me like a manga schoolgirl. cutie.

> for love! (staring at her chest) yep definitely love

> he would commit tax fraud and white collar crimes to get me a new mercedes and i think thats peak romance

> reliable little mop

> He brings out the wife inside me

> He's like, old and will treat you like a slice of pie!!!!!!!!

> tsumugi would be a wonderful husband. he works very hard and is very very nice. he would always be there to listen to you and give advice. he would cook, clean, and support you. also tits

> He's a little pathetic so I bet it will be easy to fluster him and I need to make him whimper 

> Hard worker and very nice and soft! Wouldn't mind spending the rest of my life with him...

> It's a difficult choice between Tsumugi, Mao and Arashi because they are the closest thing you have to normal people in this hell game (affectionate). Mugi has his shit together though. He overworks himself a bit but he's got a good heart and cares a lot about people. Mao also possesses those qualities so like, technically he should be the better candidate because he did not commit War Crimes(tm) and contribute to a very traumatic event in enstars lore but like. I like Mugi better. Sorry Maakun. Better luck next time.

> I like him ♡ I have two tattoos for him because I have mental illness and I will be getting his face on me + his like super domestic seeming and rlly sweet? Idk i feel like he’d be the type to do stupid little things that would make my day. Also i want to punch him and so marriage = punchability? Right?

## 16TH PLACE -- SHU ITSUKI (21 votes)

> i like her :3

> he is perfect husband material. cooks well, cleans well, sews, he is SO cute and SO handsome and SOOOOOOOOOOO talented. he would support you on your passions and push you to become the best at what you love! he is gap moe and adorable. he likes to cuddle. he would make clothes for your stuffed animals. you would feel special if he decided he loved you. rich as fuck

> me and my girl dont argue she bash my head in with a rock and i walk it off like a man

> I just want to be his acanthe fr

> gay, pink hair, nice clothes, big boobs

> Bro has sm babygirl potential but none of yall are ready to talk abt it

> call me old fashioned, but i live to serve my wife. if she told me to shut up I WOULD. if she told me to kill myself i WOULD. shes mad? thats my fault. ill do better next time. i cook the food, i clean the dishes, i do the washing, and if shes upset, thats on me and i need to improve and mature. if she made my diet consist only of croissants id accept it. if she asked me to do something id do it. but god forbid she ask for a divorce id kill everything and EVERYONE just to not let that happen. id do anything for my wife. idk if. this was the point of this section btu i like shu itsuki

> I literally wouldnt marry anyone out of this list other than SHU. Totally unbiased choice as your next door ValkP. But like, my man can make me THE BEST CROISSANT every morning for breakfast and I can listen to croissant monologues????? What more can a person ask for. So romantic 😍  Also he's a funny pink man that comes with Mado-Nee as a side dish.

> Shu Itsuki would be the BEST partner and let me tell you WHY. Firstly!! He already know how to clean and cook so you don’t have to be worried about being in RAGS. Secondly he goes above and beyond with EVERYTHING EVER so you will always have the BEST OF THE BEST already. There’s nothing higher then him {"<"}3. Thirdly, if ur ok with it, you have the extra of MIKA KAGEHIRA because Valkyrie will NEVER SEPERATE!!! So not only do you get the ALTEADY PERFECT EMACULATE STUNNING BREATH TAKING WIFE OF SHU ITSUKI but also the BIGGEST PLUS that is the one and only MIKA KAGEHIRA!!!

> He would make me so many pretty outfits and buy all the croissants 

> sugar mommy 

> I'm a Rei simp, but Shu is malewife material. He knows how to sew, cook, bake, etc. He can help me improve those things. Plus he singlehandedly improved my pediophobia. Y'all don't understand how this has improved my quality of life.

> He will make me a schedule and force me to follow it so we can have a beautiful productive life. He's really beautiful, seriously. 

## 15TH PLACE -- IBARA SAEGUSA (23 votes)

> the thought of ibara poisoning me for life insurance +pity from the masses as a pathos driven tactic to cover up scandals makes me wanna kick my feet up and squeal into my pillow 😕

> i want to experience what a divorce with him would be like

> He would have the craziest drama at our child’s school  PTA meeting but otherwise a competent wife

> Yes I want the character who said his ass itched when Nagisa called him a good boy…

> my girl tell me to shut up and i do

> realistically ibara would be horrible to be married to but what am i gonna do not marry her? she'd enthusiastically break down my door at 4 in the morning (we sleep in separate rooms) to tell me that shes invested in crypto and id be like thats great honey do you want breakfast. and shed say no and tell me that my cooking is so horrible it should be an art form and id ask her if we can renew our vows . and shed say no

> Homie can cook/bake canon does it for eden ALL THE TIME!!! along with takes care of bloody mary, and i got 2 cats myself so i know he's okay with pets. he's also a short tempered man, along with me so i wanna argue with him over dumb shit like why eating rice with a spoon is better than a fork. he just seems fun yet serious at the same time and im ready for a challenge

> My Wife. My Angel my Love. Words cannot describe how my heart wells for you, how it's ripped open with every perfect word you say... You Complete Me

> She would be probably somewhat responsible compared to me 🥲

> Ibara can cook, scold me sometimes if I am being lazy, and the most important thing is he's fun to tease ( T∀T) sorry for not choosing Naru-chan even though I am KnightsP *(son note: i forgive you {"<"}3)*

> Ibara saegusa is literally a whole ass ALPHAmart. He can cook, clean, do my taxes, strangle people, work and is a great fashion designer. I think he's made too perfect and that he can be my cute sexy wife

> She basically takes care of nagisas every need so she can cook and clean for my lazy ass as well and on top of being an idol in a super popular and successful unit shes also their producer and Vice President of Cosmic Production and she runs a bajillion other businesses. In short she can (1) keep our house livable (2) keep me alive (3) multitask (4) give me a lot of money. Sorry i cant be funny ibara is just so wife yk

> i could make her worse 

> We are married!

> Erm who else would anyone marry 😂😂?? Can cook. Can braid hair. Can manipulate a little bit as well. Why wouldn't you ... Lol ... Will salute you (good!)

> I love my men to be religious and just a little bit insane!

> i heart tatsumi kazehaya hes so silly and he is perfect malewife material 👍 i would go to church with him on sundays

> I js feel like Tatsumi would be a very sweet lover. And eventually also marry their partner. Since he always loves very passionately. Please marry me, Tatsumi.

> he can call mayoi his wife all day, but we all know who the real malewife is

> Is it even a question? XD Man is true house husband material, canonically good with the kiddos and just everything someone would want in a spouse. Plus he's cute as heck and the sweetest thing👉👈🥺💖 

> He'd treat me right 😤 and I can drive for the both of us. Serious note he'd kind of teach me that it IS possible to have a healthy relationship with religion even if I don't ever take up a religious belief again

> Hes an angel Thats all I gotta say

> HES SUPER PATIENT AND KIND sorry ik this is such a boring response but hes just super saintly and i feel like id be safe around him yk like i can mess up around him 100 times and hes one of the only charas who i can fully trust wont get pissed at me. hes super gentle, forgiving, and very non judgemental, hes someone i wouldnt be scared to be open with and make mistakes around, not to mention hes also rlly fun and easygoing. and i also love how compassionate he is. he goes out of his way to help others when possible. truly an angel sent from the heavens. atp hes overqualified i think.

> He's kind and fucking good with his hands. I'd let him exorcise the devil out of me

> I feel like Tatsumi would be less likely to argue with someone about having their 10th cup of instant noodles in a single day. Other than that, he reminds me of a huge ass teddy bear. (That I’d like to hold.)

> we r actually married and have 2 cats, can confirm he’d make the perfect husband bcuz he is the sweetest spoingly ud meet. thank u.

> can cook and clean. very loving evil creature. harbors 4000 mental illnesses. would help me understand taxes. can actually take criticism unlike my married parents

## 13TH PLACE -- KEITO HASUMI (25 votes)

> he's my boo boo bear and he's so babygirl 😍😍

> I’ve never played enstars in my life but I need him so bad you don’t understand . his stupid 🤓 face and unattractive personality has captivated me . I need to personally become an enstar just to have the chance to speak with him

> (normal ) i need to watch him fix a toaster or something

> Tbh none of them are ready theyre all horrible and wretched I stared at this for like 20 minutes and my head was(is) blank I cannot think

> I wear glasses I want to make the child with the WORST eyesight in the history of eyesight. Our child is born wearing glasses, it formed them in the womb.

> he would definitely nag me for me to get my work done, he can cook and he can draw manga as well.... it's perfect for me ({"<"}- someone who needs another to nag them to get work done, can cook like 3 dishes total, and is an eternal manga addict)

> He's nice he reminds me of my actual bf and i like himn :D

> hes so pathetic and nerdy it's charming. his megaloser interests combined with how caring he is for people hes fond is cute 😕

> he’s hot. serious and cares for the ppl he loves. he’d be a great husband ngl. also did I mentioned he’s hot

> i just like his pathetic babygirl rizz we can be cringe4cringe together 

> Keito is the best husband because he is one hundred percent responsible. he is very caring for his family and reliable. I would say that his sense of responsibility and serious attitude sets him apart from the other characters because he is WAY too responsible. 

> He wears glasses and GREEN, that means he's smart, wise, handsome and cool. Every man should be like that

> i put keito in my mouth so he can be closer to my braincell (singular) which he has to live inside of forever because i said so. you know who i am *(son note: hi keito eater)*

> we both like gambling. clearly nothing could go wrong here

> rinne is a mean lean off the shits machine but he still knows what he's doing. has life experience to know shit but isn't lame and a nerd who won't try new things. also indigenous king rise up.

> i want hiiro to be my cute brother in law so that i can give him motherly warmth and squeeze him

> Honestly I would think of something clever to put here but I have nothing I'm just a simp

> Have u seen the way that guy treats niki shiina. i think he would make the perfect partner

> my friend told me to vote for him

> (heavy breathing) he can . carry me around the house. heart emoji. and in return i cook for him hashtag homosexuality *(son note: did niki write this one)*

> He want to do nuts but he's a "save the kiss after we get married" type of man. I'm giving him mercy.

> besides great sex and constant excitement in our marriage, he’s the type of man to have a twerk off with some random guy we hired as Elmo at our kids first birthday party.

> im literally married to rinne so i should know

> Rinne would be the best husband, in my opinion. He like do anything for the people he cares about, plus he’s funny and smart. Who doesn’t love that in a man? He’d literally constantly buy gifts and show love to his partner. Rinne Amagi is a malewife, and I firmly believe it. He learns to cook for his partner, and presents breakfast to them while they’re still waking up. 

> Rinne believes very much in marriage (said in his first idol story) he says is a very important thing to do in life and that he’d choose very wisely his partner. He thinks that marriage must be with someone you love the most and that he’s still waiting for them, thats why I think Rinne is more suitable for marriage. He can also fight cows who doesn’t want a man who can fight cows? Thats very hot, you know? Rinne would love you a lot if you are chosen as his partner and if you choose to have kids dont worry about them getting traumatized and end saying I kin kaoru hakaze feom the rythm game ensembel stars

> He's the only normal person in the entire franchise.

> good christian woman who properly takes care of her kids what more could you want

> I'd go to his place to pet his rabbit all the time

> he is normal. he is pretty. he goes to university. he has kids that he cares about to the point that he is ready to kill someone for them. good wife material.

> he is just so reliable and helpful and would do anything for you if he really loves you. plus you also get to be the parent of three beautiful children

> Proud father of 3 kids that come as a bonus with marrying him. Perfect husband material. You might have to crouch a little at the altar though…

> He’s just a scrunkly. A scrunkly scrimblo you cannot tell me he wouldn’t take care of you. He would.

> i have the strong want to take care of him. i also feel like he'd take good care of me. and together we'd raise the other members of ra*bits like one big happy family. but mainly because i'm terrified of everyone else. i would not survive. to me nazuna is the most normal. the rest are all either too serious or too unserious (totally not biased) my second choice would be arashi tho i love her (stan the queen) 

> I have daddy issues. The big brother side of him got me bro is breathtaking like- marry me?????

> He makes sure to take care of those around him is one thing. And that he encourages those around him to improve. He generally supports  and cares for those around him.

> i imagine being partners romantically with nii chan would be very nice, when youre not feeling yourself or under the weather, he'll be there to talk through things with you, to really be there for you and provide whatever comfort you need. Personally, i crave physical affection when i'm sad, and rab*its are especially tactile. Even if its not in a romantic sense, hugs from nii chan would definitely make anyone feel better. Nazuna is loving, his little stutters are adorable, i find myself falling in love with him more and more everyday! His geniune overflowing amount of kindness is another key point that makes him such a good partner! I'm not sure if this answers the question well, but Nazuna brings me lots and lots of happiness and I hope others find the same comfort in him as well ^^ *(son note: cute....,...)*

> Government assigned malewife who can kill your enemies what more could you want?

> the yuzuru fushimi can cook, clean, wash your dishes (if you want him to) what are you even doing in your house atp ?? you will have a beautiful spouse / butler / guardian, literally what more could you possibly ask for ?? 

> Sorry but HE'S LITERALLY A MALEWIFE WHO WOULDN'T WANT A MALEWIFE?? Okay I'm actually gonna be self projecting but he's everything I want to be as a boyfriend. I read his stories and I'm taking notes on how to become the ultimate malewife. Whoever has his hand is lucky to find a malewife in their life. In a timeline if I am dating Yuzuru I will be serving him instead. If he cheats it's because I was lacking. He owns me. 

> Honestly I think Yuzuru would be really cute + I love him. So much 🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥

> He’s so pathetic that he will never leave you. You’ll always have a hype man no matter what, I think even after 40 years of marriage this dude will still be a drooling mess any time you flash an ankle…

> hes like one of the most pathetic manfail there is but he loves his mom i'll give him that he can be so smitten around anzu i think it's adorable when he's genuine also his double bridal themes. what the fuck happyele {"<"}- THEY PUT HIM IN A PONY TAIL !!!

> He's been training his entire life to reach the perfect example of “man that anzu (or every other woman/man/mostlyman) would marry” so I'd trust Kaoru (he's still disfunctional tho 🤔)

> I think Kaoru's a really sweet person and his growth from a character who only cared about girls to now being able be a great senior and friend to those around him. Of course the girl that's still on his mind is Anzu and I think he really cares about her, especially when he said he was looking for places Anzu might like and keeping a list of them. He might not be everyone's match but I think his personality is influenced by trying to reclaim the pieces of happiness he got when his mom was around. I love how he has turned out and I want him to continue growing and becoming a better character with each story he is in {"<"}3333

> Kaoru would be so loving and sweet 🥹…. I would love to marry him 

> he is a responsible adult from a good family who also happens to be a giggling blushing mess whenever he crushes on someone

## 8TH PLACE -- EICHI TENSHOUIN (48 votes)

> Here's why Eichi Tenshouin is a Gold Digger's dream man: 
>
> (Disclaimer: In the scout story Pretty Mission, Eichi says that it is inevitable he will marry someone chosen by his family for the benefit of the Tenshouin Zaibatsu. All arguments here are made under the assumption marrying Eichi allows one to take the “place” of a spouse deemed suitable by the Tenshouins). 
>
> – Filthy rich; to the point I don’t think anyone would notice if tens-of-thousands of dollars went missing. You would never have to work another day in your life. Your entire family wouldn’t have to work another day in their lives. Is having that much wealth unethical? Yes. But you know what they say: if you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em. 
> 
> – Eichi would not give a fuck if you had extramarital affairs. As long as it doesn’t damage his reputation or the reputation of the Zaibatsu, its all good. Chances are he’s having them too. 
> 
> – In Element, Eichi says that his mother “collects fighter jets” and “thinks she is the reincarnation of Marie Antionette”. I don’t know about everyone else but that sounds like someone I’d want to meet (and my personal first choice for extramarital affairs). 
> 
> – If you don’t think you can put up with Tenshouin family bullshit, marrying Eichi just to divorce him is also an option. The problem is you would need to (somehow) make sure he marries you without signing a prenup. Considering how much Eichi loves his contracts, I’m not sure how one would go about this. But then again, if you manage to marry Eichi Tenshouin I’m sure you could manipulate the prenup situation to your liking 
> 
> – Being Eichi’s spouse means you'd get at least some amount of media-attention. However, it would be possible to lead a very private life if you wanted to. Since the Tenshouins employ people to do all their chores for them, you could just chill in the mansion all day and not have to worry about running errands. 
> 
> – On the other hand, you could just as easily watch the world burn. Say the wildest most inappropriate things to the media, get into fights with Eichi stans on twitter, take down the Tenshouins from the inside - the possibilities are endless. 
> 
> (I apologise for writing so much I've had this on my mind for years)

## 7TH PLACE -- CHIAKI MORISAWA (50 votes)

<CardCG src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/ensemble-stars/images/7/75/%28Active_AtoZ%29_Chiaki_Morisawa_CG2.png" alt="chiaki morisawa" caption="buckle up everyone" />

> Its not exactly that hes especially suitable for marriage, but more so that he NEEDS it. And, as luck would have it, it would seem that I am presently here, readily capable to be the one to give him exactly what he needs through marriage. After an exciting, taxing day of doing his noble superhero idol work, I will be there, loyally waiting for him to come home to give him a nice massage and a delicious home-cooked meal. Upon noon, he will be brimming with joy at every lunch as he shall be free to boast amongst his peers that his partner had packed him a cute bento box for lunch, and upon opening his bento box, he shall uncover a gorgeous, exquisite bento lunch that I would have spent hours hunched-over, painstakingly crafting and planning the day prior to create the perfect bento lunch, food suitable for a hard-working man such as himself. Whenever he should have doubts or uncertainties over his convictions or his abilities, I will be there at his shoulder, to attentively listen to and sooth all of his woes. I will share with him simply what I know is the truth about him and this will be the motivation he needs to keep moving forward. And if ever should he find himself in the hospital again after some accident doing some STUPID, reckless superhero stunt, I will be there at his hospital bedside, waiting for him to open his eyes from slumber, watching the rise and fall of his chest as he breathes in peace, without a care in the world like a newborn babe, caressing the innocent serenity on his precious baby face. And then Eichi Tenshouin, my husband’s hospital roomie, will open his eyes in his hospital bed as he wakes from some frighteningly realistic, vivid nightmare, quickly patting himself down to make sure that he was safe. As he attempts to calm his racing heart, chanting to himself, “ it was only a dream, it was only a dream,” Eichi will suddenly freeze when finally feels another presence in the dimly lit hospital room, intensely watching not him, but something else. After gathering what little strength he has, Eichi will slowly turn over in his bed (which is good for him so that his body doesnt get bed sores after laying on the same side for so long) and a blood-curdling scream shall escape past eichi’s lips, as he spies across the room, my haggard stature looming over my husband’s hospital bed, a figure with frazzled hair and bloodshot eyes as I will be patiently planning exactly how im going to reprimand my husband for making me worry about him as he had foolishly landed himself in the hospital once again. And that is why Chiaki Morisawa is the most desirable for marriage. And also, it would just be absolutely criminal of him to not pass on his gorgeous good looks and good nature onto the next generation, but I can only desperately pray that my evilness would not corrupt our beautiful children.

> he’d talk about tokusatsu shows to me and i’d kick my feet around and twirl my hair and giggle

> hes the most housewife husband ever what more could you want

> chiaki is a very optismistic person and will be the perfect person to wake up to. he will most definitrly cook u a very nice meal and it will be ready for u when u wake up. he will give u good morning, good afternoon, good evening, good night, and in between how r u doing texts. he will check up on u if u show signs of not feeling well. he will kliteraly be the nciest person ever I WILL START SOBBBINNHHHMGHBFHJDFFHN 

> My depression + Chiaki's positivity = less depression

> Hes been literally dreaming of getting a girlfriend , plus hes great with kids 

> He would look extra handsome if he grow moustache and beard ngl

> Hes the most normal. I think. Probably not. But he would probably be a fun dad idk

> I'd choose Niki *(son note: dude.)* but Chiakis such a personal bias, he's just SO FUCKING BABY GIRL!! I'd marry him any day (HiMERU can be the mistress ❣️)

> I mean look at him 

> i personally think chiaki morisawa is the most suitable for marriage, i know his previous comments like women go to the kitchen may go against me but i genuinely tjink his habit of caring for others and trying to make others happy would be over the moon for people he loves, he literally has a whole family trope with the ryuseitai kids so we all know he’s gonna be a wonderful father, he would love and care for you like crazy. He would make sure your life would be the best ever. LIKE URGGGGG HE WOULD LOVE YOU SO MUCH

## 5TH PLACE -- MAO ISARA (62 votes)

> idk i just think he would be a good husband i can feel it in my balls

> literally the only chara from the list that my mom will approve

> He's already got a suit for marriage AND he can breakdance

> well see at first i thought about kaoru but thats really just cuz i want a babygirl to take care of be lets be real mao would be the nice doting husband that does stuff for you or whatever :(

> a functioning member of society

> comes with a second wife

> First of all, Mao was in a shuffle where the concept was about marriage (Ring.A.Bell haters dni I will die with their song) and he did AMAZING have you guys listened to his vocals???? He does amazing in love songs omg Finder Girl was EVERYTHING.
Another reason is the fact that he's clearly a responsible/mature person, yet he manages to have his moments of immaturity and let's himself go around those he cares about. He may believe that there's "nothing special" about him, but the thing with falling in love is that this person is special, even if others don't see. From my time in the fandom, I think this is how people who love Mao tend to act towards him. Sure, he may not have some super interesting past, but you find things about him and grow to love him for that.
Of course, there are things that should be mentioned, which are his insecurities and how it's manifested into jealousy. I myself am a huge ritsumao shipper, yet I find it weird that people have used Mao's jealousy toward Ritsu growing closer to others as a way to push the ship, when in reality it's most likely due to his insecurities. I can speak from experience when I say this, but when he saw Ritsu hanging out with others, he felt jealous not because of the jealousy we see in fanfics but because his mind goes to the possibility of abandonment. That Ritsu is going to start seeing Mao the way he sees himself - somebody who's boring and uninteresting - and leave him for others. 
Now, we can't just look at this and say that he can't be in a romantic relationship. Mao, at least from the stories I've read with him in it, doesn't really show signs of being emotionally unavailable. He cares for those he loves and while he does have many things he needs to work on, it's no doubt that he's very responsible and, if he desired, would be ready for a relationship. Especially when we put him in a non-idol setting where he won't get harassed for dating someone.

> BECAUSE BECAUSE BECAUSE HE'S JUST HUSBAND MATERIAL HE WOULD TREAT ME SO WELL AND I KNOW IT JUST TRUST 

> I sought equilibrium. 

> Most normal?

> He's a perfectly loyal good normal noodle 

> i see mao as a very helpful and caring person who he loves, i have a feeling of attachment with him and i would feel very comfortable in a relationship with him

> Will take care of you.Will take care of himself.Will take care of our future child.Will take care of our future grandchildren.Will take care of our future great grandchildren.

> Sanest character I know. I would love to live in boredom with him ❤️

> Is explanation even necessary? I mean, just look at him!! Always taking care of his unit and Ritsu so carefully, he can handle his council work without any big trouble, he got good grades, and very reliable too. Mao is perfect!!

> when i saw the post all i can think is mao

> Ok I would've chosen Kaname because he's my current oshi but Mao was my second (the Natsume oshi arc was short lived) and Kaname has a lot of issues he has to work through before he could even consider being in a relationship in the first place. I honestly haven't read that much of the actual story but hear me out. Mao has already been shown to be a caring person (taking care of Ritsu and Trickstar) and he would absolutely do anything for someone he loves. He's also very cautious, as evidenced by the scene where him and Makoto tell Anzu not to stay overnight in the same room as them, as it'll seem strange and offers to walk her home instead (among other scenes). This demonstrates how he's very careful with boundaries, which is already a good quality to have as a boyfriend. Along with that, I personally think he'd be the type to do anything for whoever he loves, and disregard what he wants so he can make them happy (I guess he does do this a lot, he doesn't really think about his feelings, only how the rest of Trickstar feels unless he's forced to). I feel as if he'd also be a very loving person and be very affectionate with his lover (after he stops being worried and awkward). Of course Mao does have his issues, especially with communicating how he feels about things. As evidenced by his experience with Nagisa, he doesn't have very high self esteem, nor is he very willing to talk about his feelings. This could cause issues in a relationship and cause him to feel unloved, inadequate, or unheard, while also being completely aware that it's his fault he feels like he can't talk about things. Again, this ties into how he wants to see his loved ones happy... He doesn't want to burden anyone with how he feels, probably in part due to his lack of self esteem as well. Of course, after this issue is taken care of, he'd definitely be a lot happier in a relationship, which is ultimately what we want.
Of course, I'm probably wrong about a lot of this (I don't know his full crimes against humanity list, which most Enstars characters have), but from what I've seen with his interactions with Anzu, he definitely seems to be the type of person you'd want to be in a relationship with, being that he's very caring and loving once shown that it's ok for him to be as such.

> because hes my favorite, i would be best friends with his sisters, i love him, were already married, oh my god, were at the honeymoon sorry gtg

> Adonis is a kind and loving character from what i know plus she’s very pretty, she cares and she’s very silly and that’s pretty much what you would want in someone. She has her flaws here and there (probably i forgot) but she’s basically a saint. Same thing with Wataru, She’s not a saint but She would be a good partner because she genuinely cares about her loved ones and she’s enjoyable and and and and blwos the guck up
>
> Reasons why Adonis is the perfect husband cough Malewife cough
>
> 1. He would treat you with utmost respect and adoration
> 2. He's so sweet and would remember every small detail you say
> 3. I just know he would be a great cook I just do
> 4. He strong he protecc
> 5. He would be an absolute best big spoon
> 6. I just know that he's a best cuddler he's just like a teddy bear!
> 7. He's the type to cover the table edge when you bent down to get something under the table
> 8. He will teart your heart with absolute care
> 9. He might be a little bit awkward but if you're feeling sad he will try his best to cheer you up!
> 10. 10/10 warm and comfortable hugs
>
> And etc. 

> domestic feminist king . the only women respecter in enstars. 

> he's just malewife... would choose kuro and niki too but mmm adonis {"<"}3

> Adonis is so very sweet!! all the enstars characters are a little insane but I think adonis has a womanly charm while being a man. a gender professional.

> He's literally the best?? He cares so much.... He jus' so cutesy....

> I don't know him that well, but from what I DO know, he seems like a very good boy. Like he's cares about his family and does his best to help.

## 3RD PLACE -- NIKI SHIINA (68 votes)

<CardCG src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/ensemble-stars/images/3/34/%28Sweet_Spider%29_Niki_Shiina_CG.png" alt="niki shiina" caption="my little blueberry muffin" />

> he’d be my beautiful wife who cooks cutely in cute aprons and i’ll be happy eating a gourmet meal with him *(son note: you're so right)*

> Male wife. He cooks and is a sweet bundle of joy that I wanna squeeze and cuddle everyday. Plus waking up to Niki with lose hair every morning :) *(son note: normal)*

> I want him to cook for me. He is so cute. *(son note: HE IS SO CUTE so true)*

> he does the cooking, i do the cleaning and making the money for the family (niki, our 5 cats who are named after warrior cats characters, our chickens that we use to get free eggs, the mysterious creature living in our attic, and i)

> I do nt jnow how to cook

> *kamala harris voice* i love good food!!

> Hes respectful gorgeous and he cooks why isnt he real #stannikishiina

> rinne is onto something

> at the sight of him lust not meant to be known by any man consumes me

> he can cook. he can clean. he's a joy to talk to. he's a great listener. he's generally mentally stable, which is so hard to come by in enstars /j

> Niki! He's a silly guy but out of everyone I believe that he's the best person to marry out of everyone. And plus he cooks who doesn't love a man who cooks ANYWAYS I guess the only downside is trying to be Acustomed to his diet/his constant need for food but besides that? I think he would be an amazing partner :)) kind and considerate, playful and lively etc etc he's. He's literally just some guy but he's a very lovely guy 🫶

> the dream stay at home husband

> I completely understand Rinne's desire to marry Niki...one of the few things Rinne and I have in common
Ok first off, Niki is pretty...like super pretty, and he's adorable, he would let me give him heatpats all day as long as I fed him and honestly, it's a fair trade. He's a very sweet boy who would make food for us to share and always make sure his partner is well fed and taken care of. He'd also probably love hugs and cuddles very much and just overall all the sweet nice things in a relationship. And have you even seen the way he treats Rinne? While he gets annoyed or upset with Rinne at numerous occasions, he still stays by Rinne's side and takes care of him no matter what and he deeply appreciates Rinne for everything he does! So anyway Niki is perfect Husband material and you cannot change my mind.
I apologize for this I am way too sleep deprived to write something with an actual coherent structure, but you should get the idea of why Niki = good husband material :)

> my wife i can feel it in my bones

> no need to go to a fancy restaurant this man will cook u a 3 ☆ michelin in his own apartment  

> niki my buffet baby 🤤🤤😍😍

> imagine the BANGER food this man would cook you oh my god if u ignore the slight chance u'll probably find a hair in ur food u'd be living amazingly frfr

## 2ND PLACE -- ARASHI NARUKAMI (70 votes)

> when arashi makes a mistake in her exam, the universe corrects itself. cars look both ways when arashi crosses the road. when arashi goes to school shes teaching the teachers. when arashi was late to school everyone apologized for being early. when arashi lies it becomes the truth. when arashi celebrates christmas she gets the most presents. when arashi buys something the money comes back to her. when arashi was born she named her parents. when arashi gets insulted by someone, the person is getting deleted from the universe. when arashi goes to the restaurant she cooks her own food. arashi is the world.

> marrying a woman is 100 times better than marrying a man

> Out of all the people listed here I feel she's the only one that hasn't commited a felony… yet…

> she would be my #1 hypegirl. she would never let me be sad AND she would go shopping with me. she's perfect

> i would do anything for her, her presence makes me smile and i wish to give her a happy life as well. a marriage has its ups and downs, but i know our love will be strong and i would sacrifice everything i have to make her happy (this isn't really entertaining, sorry)

> if we overlook her crush on akiomi she has no flaws whatsoever and ik she would treat me right

> i can be a good housewife for her ill cook and clean

> I'm into fashion she's into fashion we will be the worlds most stylish marriage and also i might get to hear ensemble square gossip and i want to hang out wjtb pretty 5

> I Wont Her

> She'd make an amazing wife! Shes so kind and caring when it comes to the ones she loves. I have never dated a trans person before, but I totally would for Arashi! She's so perfect and pretty !!
like can i genuinely marry her she does not leave my brain at all she is all i talk and think about and i am being dead serious shes the only thing thats occupied my brain for like a year and a half i am on my hands and knees i will marry her

> im gay

> We can be cute together and show the world the power of trans sapphics

> Anyone would want to marry Arashi Narukami let’s be honest 🫡

> call me old fashioned but I was raised to serve my wife. I clean the dishes and cook her food. I do whatever she says bc she is my wife and she makes the rules around the house. she owns me. I am her property. if she ever cheats on me it's bc I was lacking.

> i love arashi a very normal amount. she makes me go insane every time i think about her. every time there is anything new related to her i go crazy and suddenly she is the only person i can think about for the next day. head empty, no thoughts just arashi. she is the most wonderful nicest person i have ever seen. every time she does something nice whether it be in game interactions, fanart, fics and etc. i lose my mind. how can there be such a perfect human being? and then seeing her in pain or sad makes me feel sad too and it makes me want to protect her from all the painful parts of life. if she so asked it i would submit my life to/ for her without even a millisecond of doubt. i have never thought feeling this much love for a person, or a fictional character no less, was possible until i found arashi. i love her so so much.

## 1ST PLACE -- KURO KIRYUU (110 votes)

<CardCG src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/ensemble-stars/images/c/cc/%28Old_Vagabond%29_Kuro_Kiryu_CG.png" alt="kuro kiryuu" caption="congrats king!!! #KUROSWEEP" />

> he’s a wife. he’s like literally the most wife guy in the world half of es wants his hand in marriage and SO DO I. there are no downsides to marrying him. you get eternal free drip. you get the nicest guy alive. he would die for you and he has connections and he’s— #kurosweep

> if he doesnt win this poll, everyone will lose their life

> Literally look at him.

> kuro kiryuu………………………………………

> to explain in genshin impact terms basically i would be alhaitham with the nine to five and kuro would be like kaveh the housewife that cooks and cleans and gossips with his buddies akatsuki and we'd be haikaveh at its peak in january 2023 when 3.4 first dropped

> he has a sister so he know how to treat women right #feminist

> SOMEONE Has to do stuff in the house and it will Not be me

> MAN KNOWS HOW TO TAKE CARE OF SOMEONE! gentle... kind.. caring... listen. I don't produce Kuro but ZOO WEE MAMA. if anyone can take care of a wife/husband/marriage partner, it Has to be him. Big strong, but also doting and caring. be still my ever beating heart!!!! I think he would be the perfect mix of protective yet understanding, caring and kind. thats a man!!! thats a man!!!!

> i’m an eichiP but kuro is so nice and sweet he’s really caring and he’s also very handsome. i think he would love unconditionally and as i’m writing this i’m thinking adonis too…..,,, brb when you read this know that i went back and changed it to adonis. jk i’m sticking with kuro bc he’s good at a lot of things and technology  *(son note: crying LMAO)*

> Hes sooooo pretty and handsome and he has such a big heart. he would do anything for the person he loves. hes good with kids. i want to blow him to smithereens hes lkterally kuro kiryu

> big man 🙏

> malewife, enough said… also titties

> in my extremely biased opinion kuro is the father to end all fathers. pls look at the way he cares for his sister and his loyalty to akatsuki for reference. also! hot. that’s it

> 1 out of 4(?????????????. ???????) sane enstars characters

> Okay but have you heard his voice? Have you seen his smile??? That man is worth living for.

> Ok so as you can see from my fav units the choosing of Kuro is ENTIRELY unbiased . like dude. you know hes already taken such good care of his sister . imagine a husband or wife come ON. look at this man and tell me that he cant cook your family a full 10 course meal on holidays at ur house. he can sew and mend clothes. i just know he knows the exact substance to throw on a red wine stain to make sure it washes out. NOT ONLY HIS YNDENIABLE SKILL AT HOUSE TASKS LIKE, THIS IS A HUSBAND WHO CAN AND WILL PROTECT YOU. HES STRONG AS HELL. HE CAN COOK CLEAN MEND PROTECT AND LOVE!!! TELL ME ANYTHIMG WRONG WITH
THIS CHOICE. plus you know from
his idol activities he can operate at early morning hours like hes down and ready to be a perfect husband 25/8 !!!! ok i think that concludes the essay. i literally font even like kuro that much i just know hes basef and malewife pilled

> thanks for being normal

> Him and Nazuna are the most well adjusted but I'm not ready to be a father of three yet. Also look at that skillset

> i could write a mafia boss wattpad romance story about us

> first of all, i am a huge madara and kuro fan but i am literally THE. THE ONLY. madara fan like I AM THE ONLY MADARA FAN EVER so me sayingg kuro says a lot. first of all, without a mother kuro hes been so stable and able to do stuff around the house that NO MF CAN DO LIKE HE HAS A YOUNGER SISTER THAT HE PICKS UP FROM KINDER OR SMTH AND THE CHILDREN FREAKING LOVE HIM.although he has a past of being a delinquent,  he managed to easily adapt to being a sweet and funny guy that may be strong and sometimes perverted. he uses his strength for good and no longer skips classes (well.. hes graduated). hes so important to akatsuki too like one of the most prestigious units of ensemble square and he pulls so much weight for all his units. also hes like so hot like SO HOT OH YM GOSSUjdbf like who would not want a hot, strong, tall, kuro kiryu, cat liker, big brother, red head, cant eat spaghetti, sews, sews to relieve stress, does chores, can carry grown men his size actually i have a list of 100 reasons to like kuro:
