# it's here--! the ensemble stars characters that are most desirable for marriage!

hello! i conducted a [survey on twitter](https://twitter.com/HELLOGlRLS/status/1619519203962421250?s=20) asking ensemble stars fans who they believe to be the most and least desirable for marriage. this was inspired by a survey conducted in among the korean fanbase. the survey i did received almost **1000** responses, and i'm excited to share the results with you all!

here's how the survey worked:

- i asked responders to choose only **one** character for most and least desirable each. this is because i wanted people to think about who they were choosing and provide a thoughtful (yet hilarious) response.
- for the most desirable section, i limited the character options to those that are 3rd years or older. this was the sake of my own sanity as someone in my 20's.
- i kept the survey open for a week, as i was told that if i kept it open for any longer it might lose traction.

so, with that listed out, let's get started, shall we?
