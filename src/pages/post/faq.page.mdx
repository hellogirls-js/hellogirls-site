# frequently asked questions

hello, i noticed i've been getting some repeat questions on my retrospring so i'm gonna answer them right here! if i get more questions along these lines then i prob won't answer them cause i'm sorta getting tired of answering them OTL

### what made you want to start coding?

you can read my coding origin story on the [homepage of this site!](https://hellogirls.info) it's short, sweet, and very geeky T__T

### how did you learn how to code/do you have any coding resources?

i've been coding websites for a very long time so it's hard for me to remember all of the resources i've used to learn. i recommend websites such as [the mozilla docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web), [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/), [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) for specific questions you have along the way, and in-person classes if a curriculum keeps you motivated! good luck :3

### can you help me with this coding bug i have?

i'll be honest i will most likely redirect you to stackoverflow because i'm bad at debugging things on the fly.

### can you give me tips on coding something that doesn't involve web development

i only focus on web development and javascript and i will also redirect you to stackoverflow... sorry...

### hey one of your websites has a bug

if you're able to describe the bug well enough to fit in a retrospring ask then please send it via retrospring! but if it's more convoluted or you're gonna send a vague description then please DM me or [my dev account](https://twitter.com/hellogirls_dev)

### [something related to makotools]

this is the reason why i wrote this up in the first place ðŸ’€ please either dm the [makotools twitter account](https://twitter.com/es_makotools) or drop your concern in the [discord server](https://discord.gg/TVVuahrD8d) i am on my hands and knees please dont send makotools related concerns in my askbox i am not the person you should be asking please. also please do not dm me with any makotools related concerns either.

### what do you think of [insert character who isn't niki]

You do not want to know the answer to that question.

### can you unblock me

if i don't remember why i blocked you and you don't fall under my dni then i will unblock you for free, sorry bout that! ^w^ if i do remember why i blocked you or you fall under my dni then i will unblock you for the small price of [one niki nui](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/hellogirls). so gamble wisely
