> naru is the perfect wife actually. here's the real problem
> r/relationships
> My SIL is being overbearing and controlling. I recently married my lovely wife (18F), we can call her A. Her family is great for the most part, except for her sister (19M), called I. He's the most nitpicky person I've ever met and I knew this going into the relationship but he's gotten even worse since we got married. He always looks at me like I'm not good enough for her (which I agree with, no one is good enough for A) but he's always giving me a stink eye. They're both successful models, but I am not the most fashionable person around, so he goes after my fashion the most, saying stuff A should not be seen with you in public. Luckily, he lives in Florence with his boyfriend, L, most of the time so I can get away from most of it. I've talked to A about this and while she's tried to tell him off, he's not very cooperative since he's older and thinks he's in the right. They're both very important to each other and going NC wouldn't be realistic since they work together a lot. Anyways, is there any way for me to appease him? Family dinners are getting awkward.*

> listen arashi is great n amazing and i think she is simply show stopping. HOWEVER. i dont know if i can deal with having izumi as an in law. so i think she deserves better.

> she's the perfect woman but i don't want izumi sena at my wedding bc the ceremony would end with us in a duel until one of us dies, changing the trajectory of the lives of everyone present

> Is he a great person? Absolutely. I love Nagisa. He's beautiful and brutally honest (which is a quality I tend to appreciate), however this man's hyper fixations are so strong that he would gift you nice jewelry for some special occasion and end up staring at the stone more than you. That's fine on the first few dates — cute even — but when it gets to your fifth year anniversary, you've probably heard all about how every single crystal is formed.

> Subaru is so annoying, and everyone agrees with this. He's insensitive and more, I would continue, however the list is too long.

> Subaru's like the type of guy whose nine year old past self would form a connection with you in the "future" using the collective consciousness. Like you just wake up one day and you hear his voice in your head and it's his nine year old voice and you're like eighteen and he's asking you to save his dad from dying. And also eighteen year old Subaru is right in front of you while eight year old Subaru is speaking in your head. I hope that made sense. This is why I wouldn't marry Akehoshi Subaru of Trickstar Enstars fame.

## 27 PLACE -- MIDORI TAKAMINE (12 votes)

<CardCG src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/ensemble-stars/images/f/fa/%28Mascots_Lover%29_Midori_Takamine_CG.png" alt="Midori Takamine" />

> "Let me start this by saying that this is the LEAST ready for marriage. I am not here to say that Midori is unable to have a wonderful relationship/marriage, especially because some of the reasons I will be mentioning are things that I can relate to, and I am very happy in my current relationship. Mental illness does not mean somebody cannot date, but this is the least ready, not ""should not be in a relationship""
> Midori has shown clear signs of mental illness throughout the story, even making it clear that they're suicidal. While this in of itself isn't a reason as many characters have been shown to experience mental health issues, it does lead us to show that their mental state isn't getting much better since they were first introduced.
> Let's use Leo for an example in the infamous story ""Checkmate"". Leo is shown to be extremely mentally unwell, going to extreme, unhealthy methods of coping, relying on Izumi for stability (and vice versa) and eventually, running away, leaving Izumi to believe he failed to ""protect"" him. As a result, Izumi tells himself he won't let this happen again and becomes obsessive over Makoto.
> Within these examples however, it should be noted that the majority of the conflict that surrounded this has been handled. Makoto and Izumi are on good terms now, and Izumi and Leo have been working on moving on from their past. They work on it, want to work on it and their work shows.
> Now, when we take Midori however, there really isn't much that shows that they've been working on their current mental state, nor does it show that they plan on working on it. I don't know enough about their character to put the ""emotionally unavailable"" label on them, but it should be mentioned that as time goes on, this will only get worse. Mental illness isn't something that can go away within the blink of an eye, and a support system cannot fully replace therapy.
> Once again, I am not here to say they cannot be in a relationship, nor is this all to Midori's character. However, out of this entire cast, I do believe that Midori being the least ready makes the most sense, at least in my mind."

He expects you to stay home, cook, and clean. He would also try to be heroic in every situation to the point it'd be embarrassing for his partner. Imagine being mugged and he jumps in and goes on about justice? Chiaki would see his partner as unfit to defend themselves, despite being barely able to defend them.

## 10 PLACE -- MIKA KAGEHIRA (26 votes)

<CardCG src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/ensemble-stars/images/0/0f/%28Distant_Art%29_Mika_Kagehira_CG.png" alt="Mika Kagehira" />

> I would never be Mika's no1 in his life, imagine living under Itsuki Shu's shadow

> Remember when he tried to bury his roommate alive

> I do not mean any of this disrespectfully but genuinely there is no character that I dislike more. For one, why marry a guy who has a boyfriend? Literally you'd end up in hand to hand combat against Shu if you ever hurt him (actually maybe this is a positive, I could absolutely take shu in a good old fashioned Turkish oil wrestle). Also. He. Imagine getting home and that creature (/neg) is there. Do you feel joy? Relief? Absolutely not. I feel immense, uncontrollable rage whenever I see him (../hj) I'd rather sleep outside everyday instead of with him I don't trust him. Also I (I may be wrong) think when shu went to his apartment in that one story it was a bombsite and it was covered in junk. Do you really want a man who doesn't pick up after himself? No. The room would smell terrible like cat litter. Also, he resembles a cat. I am allergic to cats. Idk if you can be allergic to humans but I really wouldn't be surprised if I was allergic to Mika. He looks like the type to not shower unless me (or shu) made him. I don't like men who don't shower. To conclude, I apologize if you like Mika but I cannot stand him and would not be able to tolerate a marriage. We would get divorced before it even happened.

> he would be hiding from me in the walls the entire marriage 😭

> You'd come home from work like "honey I'm home" and he'd fall through the ceiling shaking like a wet cat on the side of the street "OH HEY HONEY"

> 3/4 of the casts are unmarriable so I used a roulette to pick this one

> I am not a therapist god bless 🙏🏻

> can someone give me a single reason why mayoi would be a good character to marry

> dont get me wrong he deserves love and happiness, but i just feel like he wouldnt show up to the wedding unless he could do it over facetime

> i do not think HiMERU is capable of love he runs on hate alone

> could you imagine having sex with himeru?? "HiMERU will now fuck you. Fufu HiMERU is quite turned on" hell no

> he doesnt let things go he'd still remember that time i ate his snacks 3 years ago

> this man has a long-standing grudge/ revenge plan on behalf of his younger brother. imagine being married to him. "honey how was your day" "oh i spent approximately 5 hours stewing on the guy who i blame for getting my brother hurt." a) that's kinda homoerotic b) how are u supposed to maintain a relationship like that?? he doesn't even come home for dinner. we haven't had date night since he encountered tatsumi again. i'm readying divorce papers rn.

> Coke is the most vile thing ever concocted by man not only does it look god awful but it also tastes like sewage if you're gonna drink sewage at least drink sprite the better non arguable and non negational option

> 30 years old and doesn't know how to cook. If i asked him to handle dinner for once he'd probably say something like "HiMERU contributes enough to this marriage through his innate sexiness…♪" and i'd kill us both (and he's right? 🤨)

> I'm scared of him.

> no comment.

> He looks and act(mostly?) like a literal child I rather him to be my son than my brother honestly😭

> he's too much of a son. I want to roll him into a ball and punt him across a football field

> I'm scared of him.

> sorry girl

> I believe he's not ready yet, in the future maybe, but right now, just too immature for it. I do get that he probably does have marriage talks already, considering the fact that his parents want to marry off his little sister soon?? But honestly speaking, I don't think he's very suitable for it yet

> i feel like i’d replace yuzuru and that’s something all three of us do not want.

> He's already married. That man is in gay love with Wataru and you cannot get in the way of that. You are trying to seduce a married man. Good luck I guess but you're not getting anywhere he's got nothing but Wataru on the brain.

> eichi (eichi) [like vriska]

> I also want to put him in a jar and study him but instead of giving him treats I shake him violently every hour
