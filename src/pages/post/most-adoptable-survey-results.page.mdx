# survey results: the most adoptable characters in ensemble stars

hello, i am back! last month, i conducted a survey asking ensemble stars fans who they believed to be the most and least desirable for marriage. that poll was a huge success, so i decided to come back for round two! this time, asking people who they believed to be the most and least adoptable among the ensemble stars cast. the results for this survey was interesting and i'm excited to share them.

however, i want to do something different this time around. i wanna share who i believed would be some of the first place winners for most adoptable. i will list out my hypotheses below. these are based on observations within the fanbase as well as my own personal biases, haha. so, let's go!

## POTENTIAL WINNER #1 -- HAJIME SHINO

<CardCG src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/ensemble-stars/images/c/ca/%28Lost_Gretel%29_Hajime_Shino_CG.png" alt="hajime shino" />

this is who i truly believed to be the first place winner of this poll. hajime is cute, sweet, hardworking, and polite. he is, in my opinion, the ideal child. there is a reason why there are so many upperclassmen who care about her deeply. she is self-sufficient, making him a low maintenance child and is so sweet and loving. #HAJIMESHINOSWEEP

## POTENTIAL WINNER #2 -- KOHAKU OUKAWA

<CardCG src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/ensemble-stars/images/a/ad/%28Amber-Colored_Blossom_in_Bloom%29_Kohaku_Oukawa_CG.png" alt="kohaku oukawa" />

everyone thinks kohaku is a sweetie pie. he's cute and pink and his somewhat strict attitude makes him more endearing and you can't help but want to make her smile. she is bingus for a reason and it's because he's cute.

## POTENTIAL WINNER #3 -- HIIRO AMAGI

<CardCG src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/ensemble-stars/images/c/c9/%28Curiosity_and_Challenges%29_Hiiro_Amagi_CG.png" alt="hiiro amagi" />

hiiro is earnest and willing to learn, which makes him a joy to be around. being a younger brother as well, hiiro was made to tug at your maternal instincts. you can't help but be jealous of rinne when you see him. LUV U HIIRO!!

## POTENTIAL WINNER #4 -- SORA HARUKAWA

<CardCG src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/ensemble-stars/images/f/f9/%28Gentle_Interactions%29_Sora_Harukawa_CG.png" alt="sora harukawa" />

HaHa! sora is very sweet and has youthful energy. i'm sure he's captured the hearts of many fans and many want him to be their own kid.

## POTENTIAL WINNER #5 -- TORI HIMEMIYA

<CardCG src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/ensemble-stars/images/2/26/%28An_Inspiration_for_Someone_Out_There%29_Tori_Himemiya_CG.png" alt="tori himemiya" />

even though y'all really did not like this guy during the first survey, you can't help but admit that tori is THE original small pink thing. he's the littlest member of the cast. she's pink. she's cute. no one can help but want to pick him up from a cardboard box. i just know the tori fans will come through for this poll.

## POTENTIAL WINNER #6 -- SHINOBU SENGOKU 

<CardCG src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/ensemble-stars/images/6/61/%28StarFes_of_Bonds%29_Shinobu_Sengoku_CG.png" alt="shinobu sengoku" />

fucking look at him.

and now, with that out of the way, let's get started!

## 51ST PLACE -- KURO KIRYUU (1 VOTE)

> Because in that one care he was playing with cats and i like cats so if he also likes cats i would um.......... Adopt idk i dont play enstars sorry

## 51ST PLACE -- HIYORI TOMOE (1 VOTE)

> now he really looks adopted; he’s so much more beautiful and babygirl than me. he also seems like he will be a good son/daughter. idk gender chooses him i don’t make the rules. just looking st hiyori will complete your day i won’t even mind being his personal slave like yes honey my child i will clean after you i will cook i will work 24/7 so i can provide for you and you will just have to live your life you don’t have to work at all

## 49TH PLACE -- IZUMI SENA (2 VOTES)

> Idk

> the only one i am certain cant possibly become worse version of themselves with izumi the only way possible is 🆙⬆️💪

## 48TH PLACE -- KEITO HASUMI (3 VOTES)

> he is a polite cat and i wouldnt lock him in a room with large buddhist statues for his wrongdoings or feed him soybeans (i hate soybeans). we'd get along perfectly

> What would you do if you found a nerdy looking guy in comically large wet cardboard box in front of your house" sounds like 6 chapters + extras bl plot

> why? WHY? I WOULD ADOPT HIM AND I WILL RAISE HIM SO NICE THAT HE WILL ENJOY HIS YOUTH MY BOY NEEDS A BREAK THESE DAYS HE IS LITERALLY DOING EVERY WORK IN EXISTANCE IN THE OFFICE HES ONLY 18 WHERE ARE THE FUCKEN ADULTS OR WHATEVER IM GONN AFKCUDJCKNSKA

## 48TH PLACE -- AKIOMI KUNUGI (3 VOTES)

> single mother needs a single father (me)

## 48TH PLACE -- NATSUME SAKASAKI (3 VOTES)

> i basically live for natsume

> oddballs,,,,my beloveds. yes he has grown far more than just being a lil child but weeoooww i would like to adopt a sassy magician child who would probably curse me 24/7 because i'm too busy calling him cute. as a mainly valk/shuP and oddballsP i'm just feeling the 'sakasaki natsume, the dearest of the five eccentrics' vibe all the time and must fulfill the wishes of the eccentrics by loving natsume. cute. uehuehue.. 
>
> switch is also amazing because *insert essay on lore*

> Natsume may call producer kitten but we know whose the real cat here. My house would be free from mice and other rodents if I took his ass in. He also does magic; he could literally use magic to hypnotize an army of rats into doing chores for me and all I have to do is give him some premium cat food as a reward.

## 48TH PLACE -- HIMERU (3 VOTES)

> HiMERU is already is a wet pathetic cat that grew up in a wet cardboard box but that's alright. I'll take him home and give him a life he deserves.

> adoption out of pity. who would ever want a sopping wet cat like her. shes such a loser she literally likes collecting hats. she is literally like a little victorian orphan holding out her dirty hands. shes like that one cat thats really mean but all of the other cats were taken so you have to take this one out of guilt

## 44TH PLACE -- YUZURU FUSHIMI (4 VOTES)

> im going to fist fight his parents in a alley way and take him away

> His real family is trash, I need to protect my bb. No actually bcuz he was going to khs, that’s how you know all your parental figures failed you

> I CAN FIX HER

> i want to raise him as a spoiled prince and watch as he becomes violently uncomfortable

## 44TH PLACE -- JIN SAGAMI (4 VOTES)

> i want to introduce him to people like yeah this is legally my kid yeah hes a grown ass man yeah hes like 20 years older than me i found him in a puzzle box outside a pizza hut in the rain

> because he's a grown ass man who's constantly like :33 how could you say no to that face (he pays taxes)

> The idea of adopting a pathetic looking grown ass man sounds funny

## 42ND PLACE -- KAORU HAKAZE (5 VOTES)

> He needs a mother figure...

> He needs a better dad

> Because he is sweet

> Alright okay I'm not even a Kaoru-P or anything but hey if it means that it'll either help cure or prevent his future mommy issues then

## 42ND PLACE -- CHIAKI MORISAWA (5 VOTES)

> the generational trauma must be INSANE

> I'm adopting him, but the twist is that he's gonna be my brother (you literally can't convince me that he wouldn't make a good older brother)

> My silly little bingus he is so perfect and wowowowowow also !!! I appreciate a fellow adhd person. We will rant about our hyperfixations. Our home will be insane, but key word, it's ours.

> He would do the adopting. ryuseitai gets a sixth member!!

> i want to be a sports mom and i will bring oranges to his basketball games

## 42ND PLACE -- WATARU HIBIKI (5 VOTES)

> i would pay attention to his tricks forever i would raise him better than his adopted parents

> my sweet puppy. my meow meow even. he would jump out of the box and surprise me with whatever i desired. i adopt him but he would feed me and care for me. would revel in head pats. would make me laugh.    i just love him.  so much.

> Wataru would act like the most sopping wet cat in the box to get picked regardless of how sopping wet cat he is or is not and thus I would pick him up

> I know wataru is really adopted but I want to let him know he doesn't need to "repay" for anything, he deserves the warmest family and I just want to ask him about his day and hear him tell some casual daily life stories while I braid his hair and I'll learn to cook to give him the most nutritious meals and he'll just make my daily life very fun over the silliest things and just seeing him makes me smile and I'll raise him to open up his heart and we'll have movie nights together and I'll be very very proud of him and I'll come to all of his shows and give him very warm hugs and and and and

> i think he'll be my stepmother instead

## 39TH PLACE -- HOKUTO HIDAKA (7 VOTES)

> he would come home and say the Stupidest stuff ever and i would whole-heartedly Believe him. 10/10 conversations would be had.

> he’s a little dumb but it’s okay he’s a very polite young man I think he’s the only one I could handle living with and have as a son. i will get him all the konpeito he wants . Love you hokke🫶

> i dont know anymore i just love hokuto alot. hokuto could be sitting in a wet box and id be like "oh a new cat for my collection!" and id pick him up and put him on my wet cat shelf to be on display. id hug and kiss him everynight before putting him back on my wet cat shelf. i love hokuto. i think him being in a wet box all alone very much matches his personality. have you seen him? hes such a fucker i cant stand him. he acts like he has his shit together but in reality he fucking DOESNT like thats such a wet cat persona. also i think hes a loser and needs to have a home idfk

> I don't want a kid that will annoy me. I trust Hokuto to not destroy my house.

> His dad is a total dilf which means that if I were to marry his dad then that means that he’s legally my stepson and so I would have no choice but to adopt him as my son. I’m not really complaining though, he seems polite.

> Even I would be a better parent then that.. thing.

> Ill be a better dad to him.

## 39TH PLACE -- RITSU SAKUMA (7 VOTES)

> Oh boy there is many reasons why I picked Ritsu (but would have to make sure his best friend was here as well). Focal points being that Ritsu is basically the human version of a cat and I like cats. Besides having someone who's sleepy/needs attention would probably help me with my own issues. Wait I'm describing the literal human version of an emotional support animal.

> If I had to choose between my two ult favs in Knights (Leo and Ritsu) I choose Ritsu because I know Leo could have fun in the rain while Ritsu might just perish in the cold and wet outdoors. Tsukasa is a big contender though since I just realized boy would get kidnapped....he's got no street smarts....😟
>
> I cannot physically make myself ignore Ritsu, but if could I would stuff all of Knights in my pockets and run

> This dude is a literal cat. All you have to do to take good care of him is to give him all his needs, basically just necessities + some entertainment/recreation. He'll just sleep, eat, not bother you, bother Mao instead, and do the singing/dancing/idol activities he likes. And he's cute, so what's not to like.

> i'm not the one adopting ritsu, ritsu's the one adopting me

> i have bad taste + he's just like the cat i already have + i hate him /romantic

## 39TH PLACE -- MAO ISARA (7 VOTES)

> I just wanna pat his hair

> i think he would be a good son and i think he deserves to have a loving family and i want to make sure he is always happy and healthy an

> hes the most responsible AND normal enough character that i wouldn't mind adopting....
>
> sorry for the bland response, the only semi-funny thing i can think of is that he comes with a sleepy, lazy wet kitten son-in-law {"<"}/3

> he's like the one of the most skrunkliest scrimblo bimblo glup shitto eeby deeby horse plinko blorbo poor little tootsit meow meows in the game. i love him mao my son .. .... .. i will buy everything he wants in exchange for not allowing him to date a gay vampire who keeps climbing on his windows at 3 am and then i have to get a broom and sweep sweep so he falls off and dies and rhen mao's like NOOOOOOOOOOO MY BOYFIRNED 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭

> his eyes are big like a little bug i do not know how i could NOT adopt him if he was looking at me with those big puppy dog eyes

## 39TH PLACE -- SHU ITSUKI (7 VOTES)

> shu's gone through enough I wanna raise him properly unlike his actual parents [L parents]

> It's basically a 2 in 1 package, adopting both Shu and Mika. Let's say Shu adopted Mika, and I adopted Shu. MIka would be my adoptive grandson.

> She deserves better, her childhood was hard and I know I can fix her

> bingus

> shes my skurble dingle and shes so ugly and i have way too many croissants (its all for her)

## 35TH PLACE -- EICHI TENSHOUIN (8 VOTES)

> she is literally :3 i would pick her up out of the cardboard box and take her home. little meow meow (she has commit war crimes)

> if i adopt eichi i can change the course of ensemble stars history

> I would've given her an actual loving and caring family

> eichi may be whatever little gay villain everyone says he is but i know an overlooked child when i see one. he doesn't even need to guve me puppy eyes nor would i care if he was lost inside a gucci store or whatever, fhe moment i lock eyes with this guy's i know i would be able to feel all of his pain and even if i can't make it better by adopting him i just KNOW having someone there for him would be enough. sharing dinner, getting scolded by me not knowing how to make tea or wtv. little kicked puppy eichi would just want someone there and bonus points if we can talk about idols PLEASE EICHI I MAY BE UNEMPLOYED AND STUDYING FILM BUT I AM A BETTER MOTHER THAN YOUR CURRENT MOTHER thats it thank you

> she is so baby to me and not like in a justin beiber way but in an infant baby way and i want her. my silly little child

## 35TH PLACE -- REI SAKUMA (8 VOTES)

> he is pathetic and pitiful like a sad wet cat 😭 id feel too bad for him

> I like hanging out with people awake at night because I'm also asleep in the morning.

> rei would be so cute all wet in a cardboard box. he's the {">"}_{"<"} ever. the best cat. 100% would adopt

> I have been pondering my orb for day and days on end trying to figure out which twin to adopt. Making a 2winkP choose between the twins is fucked up and evil especially when it comes to adopting only one of them (says the person who ran a "which twin do you prefer?" poll a couple weeks ago... tehe~!). Due to having hit a brick wall with this question, I choose to not adopt either of the twins, but rather their peepaw, Vampire Prince Rei Sakuma. That way both of the twins will come over occasionally and I can live the silly little delusion that I adopted both of the twins. Besides, it's hilarious to adopt a guy who's pushing 20.

> He is the most sopping wet pathetic cat ever. You’d find him curled up in a cardboard box in the rain with mournful violin music playing in the background with the biggest saddest red eyes and he’d be crying and sniffling oioioioioi (Ritsu kicked him out and all he has with him is a stick with a red and white checkered cloth tied loosely to the end) and you just couldn’t help but take him home and give him a nice warm tomato juice because he deserves it

## 35TH PLACE -- NAZUNA NITO (8 VOTES)

> Hard working baby

> I get Nazuna. He's just like me!! So if he's just like me, I can make sure he's happy!

> He made me smile when I sad

> He's a bunny 🐰

> Very cute and propably very small kitten so he's easy to keep!

> nazuna is the cutest charc design in the game in my opinion, i love looking at his design. so if i saw him on the street, i would bring him home on spot. i know lots of people were prob going off personality, but i cant nazuna is just too adorable

> Rabbits die when they get wet

> Bestest boy

## 35TH PLACE -- YUTA AOI (8 VOTES)

> https://ensemble-stars.fandom.com/wiki/(Labyrinth_Racer)_Yuta_Aoi

> he is my son by legal definition

> im a huge jhariah fan and for some reason a jhariah lyric bot has a yuta pfp and i find that incredibly funny   like yuta   stop saying that. thats not allowed son. your not allowed to say these things who taught you these words was it ritsu

> have you seen Energetic Radiance Yuta Aoi (bloomed)

> they are my daughter I love them so much

> I love the Aoi twins equally and I know that if I choose Yuta, Hinata follows. They're a two in one deal and if I have to cheat a little to get both and make them the happiest and most pampered boys then so be it.

> 2wink as a whole exudes the aura of a drenched, shivering cat. In my mind's eye I can see it: two twin idols, huddled in a cardboard box, looking pitiful, and I gently take them by the hand and lead them out. However I realize I only have enough room for one of them. As a recent Setsubun fest reader, I want to pick Hinata: but then I realize that'd be crueler. So instead, I shed a tear, leave Hinata in that box, and carry Yuta home where he can be warm and out of the rain. And then I go back and get Hinata, because I'd rather be in the cardboard box then leave him out there.

> he is inexperienced in life. he knows nothing and needs to be cared for

## 31ST PLACE -- JUN SAZANAMI (9 VOTES)

> his loser boy charm and transmasculine swag have captivated me and as such, it is my duty to protect and shelter this poor loser boy creature and provide him with the best possible care, such as a lifetime supply of strawberries, as well as any jin sagami merch he may need (to maintain his negative parasocial relationship) i will also ensure that he will no longer be left in a cardboard box all alone, as the mere thought is too painful to bear.

> he was born to be adopted i think. in a wet cardboard box and everything

> god knows he needs a loving supportive parental figure so bad… plus he is such a polite young guy very responsible and respectful he would be very well behaved!!

> Because he’s the most precious child in this world🥺 and he’s a puppy, so why not

> jun is my best boy he is like puppy he is my world

> This is what hiyori saw in him when he picked him up. The sad little soggy sopping messy wet haired thing all alone and sad in the back alley when it’s raining, jun. aww the silly :3

> Now imagine this. It is 2am and it is pouring outside. You hear thunder in the distance but you're inside and warm where you don't need to concern yourself with such terrible weather. All of a sudden, you hear little paw scratches at your door and you can't help your curiosity - you open the door and see a little puppy staring at you with the saddest eyes you've ever seen. Fur drenched from the rain, shivering from the cold and whimpering. If you don't pick Jun then it is the same as refusing to let that little puppy in. You'll feel bad for the rest of your life and keep thinking back to that day you hurt this tiny creature with your selfish actions...make a difference for this world and all the puppies of this world and vote JUN SAZANAMI!

> Literally was picked up from a (metaphorical) cardboard box in an alley by hiyori. I dunno what to tell you, its Canon.

> I could fix him (by not sending him to idol school)

## 31ST PLACE -- MIDORI TAKAMINE (9 VOTES)

> i think he is like one of those kittens who fail to drink milk and get it all over that face. on that note he is also like a sopping wet cat that i would feel too bad not to adopt him.

> I LOV HER AND I WANNA POSSIBLE MAKE HER LIFE BETETER

> He looks like a sad cat. I have to adopt sad cats or I will literally d!e...! I'll give him all the plushies he wants

> Midori is so fuvkg sad i need to bring him in from the cold and wrap him in a soft towel while repeating “oh you poor thing” then give him a mug of warm milk and honey with cinnamon before arranging a nest of squishmallows and blankets for him in front of the fire where he will sleep while i watch from the doorway and mutter “what are we going to do with you” and decide that he must be sent to the orphanage in the morning, but while i sleep im plagued with horrid night terrors of the ghastly conditions of the orphanage and so when the man i called previously arrives in the morning to take midori away i rush to the door exclaiming “his home is here!” and slamming the door to turn to midori who has tears in his eyes and i hold him and brush them away whispering “you never have to be cold again”

> Funny enough I was stuck between Midori and the Aoi twins. But I mainly went with midori because he’s a sweetheart and I want him to happy and thrive in his environment.

> midori takamine is the most adoptable enstars characger. he is the sweetest person ever and he deserves so much love and i want to hug him. he should be loved!!!

> he probably wouldn't be that hard to raise, he's a good and helpful boy

> i think he deserves a warm meal and a weighted blanket

> He deserves so much love. I understand how people may not like his low spirit personality, but i get it (he just like me fr). He truly loves his friends and is trying his best to grow and thats all i could ever ask of someone. 
>
> We would own so many plushies.
-Please see Midoris engstar whiteday for more details. He too darn precious.

## 31ST PLACE -- TATSUMI KAZEHAYA (9 VOTES)

> tatsumi was born in a wet paper back and i need to bake him in the oven to make him crispy enough to survive

> hes small what if someone steps on him. What would happen. I need to give him a home to protect him from that

> i think i could entrust him to secure me a spot in a really nice retirement home... he's also like a wet puppy how can i not see him and leave him alone......!! i will dedicate all my finances to ensuring my son has a great honeymoon with his wife himeru

> id be so lucky to have tatsumi as my son. like, imagine? imagine this: your three other sisters are raving about how much accomplishments their children have done. but you have kazehaya tatsumi as your child. hes polite to everyone he meets like a saint, is the youth pastor for ur religions church willingly and is very good at it, and hes the perfect son. as soon as u open ur mouth, your sisters fear for their life. they know that with one sentence, you will win the battle between the children. and your son. will. be. the. example. your sisters will tell your children "why cant you be more like tatsumi?!" and you will relish in it.

> If I could I would explain in a drawing but look at it this way, imagine a random green cat in the street looking up like ^^: and it just stares at you, you try to walk pass it because a green cat is unusual and it may suck your brains but its eyes are following you. You try to walk away but then it starts raining so you feel bad for the cat, you take the cat home and its still going ^^: , you thought that it was cute and decided to keep it. Now you have a green pet cat that follows you around the house, then one day you come back home exhausted, when you enter the green cat was waiting for you to give it food. As you were about to feed him, it starts to cuddle you. You thought what was up, so you sat down with it and started petting it. Then you just talk about your day and then start ranting about the annoyances from the day and the cat sits next to you while purring as if its reassuring you that it will all be okay............................ I just realised you didn't say "what if the idols turned into cats, which will you adopt?" ... I still stand by what I said.  I still think Tatsumi will listen to your problems and try to reassure you, unless they are a child in this sense, no traumadumping yeahh. If they are a child then I would love to play with him and give him a good childhood but as an adult I would love to talk about random things
>
> (If tatsumi makes it to top 30 I will draw him as a cat)

> Actually I just want to have a lot of time together with him so that I can teach him how to drive SAFELY

> he’s just so cute he reminds me of a chipmunk I want him to be my son. I would spoil him and buy him everything he wants because he deserves it he’s so silly :3

> I just want to take care of Tatsumi

## 28TH PLACE -- SUBARU AKEHOSHI (10 VOTES)

> subaru is the wet cat i picked up from the side of the road. i will care greatly for subaru. i will cut out paper stars to put above his bed while the other idols i’ve abandoned because i chose subaru look in from the window and sob.

> I can save him

> I LOVEEEEEEE SUBARU OKAY!? he has had such a rough childhood i just want to give him the WHOLE WORLD. such a cute, wonderful, silly little guy. who wouldn't want him as a son/to adopt him!? and just look how much he suffered because of his dad. imagine being alienated because of false accusations against your father, which delves into you not having any friends or meaningful relationships. like, have you read Rocket Start? in the same day, hokke just talked to him to tell him it was his turn to do class duty, natsume just talked to him because he had ulterior motives, and he talked to koga in the same day too because he wanted to be friends (which koga refuses). even so, he was still so happy he got to talk to "so many people" in the same day. like doesn't that make you sad? he wanted friends and someone to understand him so badly that even something so small such as that made him feel a little happy. it really just highlights how lonely he was before trickstar. it makes me so sad and i just want to give him all the shiny coins in the world to make up for the loneliness he felt then. ALSO!! he's a good son (CANON) he has never forgotten his father, and he worked part time to help his mother. after his dad died his mom was really sad and he tries really hard as an idol to make her smile. he's also a silly little guy who can be blunt and say hurtful things and i still love that part about him! i would love to help him learn from his mistakes and to watch him grow. i really love him and i would definitely adopt him.

> He's such a hardworking boy! Even though he can excel at anything he works hard for it! Nothing else would make me prouder. He's the type to do anything for his family or friends and that's so valuable, and he's like so clever too! Subaru never failed an exam in his life. It's a boy who loves the world but the world didn't love him back, i want to love him. He cares so much for the people arround him and doesn't let anyone be alone like he was in the past. Even though some days he's not feeling it and fakes his smile he doesn't smile for himself but for the rest of the world, for his friends, for the people, he cares about, for his fans, i think that's pretty noble! He had to learn how to cook and do the housework at a young age and couldn't enjoy the days of his youth, I want to help him, he deserves the best, i love him dearly and maybe he can teach me how to do taxes

> “ The stars, the sky... It's all a gigantic hoax. A lie.”

> subaru is a little silly. im going to protect him from all the dangers in this big scary world. i  will feed him. water him. love him. care for him. and i will do the same for daikichi. barubaru deserves all the love in the world and ill be the one to give it to him. it would be an absolute honor to adopt the biggest, shiniest sunshine in the world.

> I love subaru shes very silly and just like a wet soggy mouse whenever u throw her she will make a EEEK sound and when u feed her she will jump around in your palm i lost what the main point of this but subaru the love of my life.shes so kissable iwanna smooch smooch here my little sillyy kyaaahh ll will run over everyone

> hes silly :-)

## 28TH PLACE -- IBARA SAEGUSA (10 VOTES)

> You see this man? That is the face of someone who was born in a wet cardboard box all alone. The epitome of a pathetic wet cat. And who would be so cruel as to deny that pathetic sopping wet mop of a cat a spot right by a cozy fireplace in your non-wet cardboard box home? Ibara deserves a nice home cooked meal, the kind that makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside. He deserves a soft bed to sleep on at night, with a pillow that’s cold on both sides. He’s gone through so much in life that he is practically owed adoption into a safe, loving environment. He is most adoptable by virtue of being considered so un-adoptable as a child that he got sent to a military camp. Even the most grumpy, anti-social cat at the shelter deserve a home that will give them the love and care they deserve.
>
> Also if he doesn't get adopted he turns into. Whatever the hell is wrong with present day Ibara. I love the guy but his self worth issues would not be as bad as they currently are if he had been adopted and avoided his time at the military camp.

> she was literally born wet and alone in a cardboard box... how can i resist those huge and sopping wet chihuahua eyes.

> dear god SOMEONE needs to show this child some love b4 she gets any more traumatized than she already is, i wld make her delicious food and shampoo her hair for her and tuck her in bed w/ a goodnight kiss and show her all the love she's always deserved but never got, and if im lucky, maybe then she'll actually believe in it ;-; (sorry this isnt funny ig her childhood just makes me emotional)

> hes so yoinky sploinky to me

> she was literally found in a wet cardboard box all alone

> He's here just to help me with business

> Self sufficient, has stonks, can take care of others and himself. As long as I don't get on his bad side (bro I'm adopting him I better not be) I'm retiring well. (I'm not godfather rich but like he can work something out I believe in him :))

> i think it’d be funny to ruffle his hair and call him “champ” just for him to start barking at me

> He's a like a little puppy trapped in a little box. You wouldn't ignore that. He whimpers, he just wants a home to live out his rock 'n' roll dreams. WONT YOU TAKE HIM IN AND LET HIM LIVE OUT HIS PASSION??!! He's a cute lil guy with a fierce facade, he needs to be nurtured a d have the best care taken of him. Therefore, I would adopt him.

## 24TH PLACE -- NAGISA RAN (12 VOTES)

> i thought about it for a long hard while (exactly five minutes) and arrived at the conclusion that if nagisa ran of eden was in a cardboard box sopping wet asking for a new home i would drop everything to file the adoption papers. i cant say no to her eyes

> are you kidding? nagisa is such a sweet guy and i just. he deserves a better childhood he deserves to know that he is loved as he is and that he should be free to explore his interests as his own person. i just... nagisa is such a blank slate when you first meet him that i want to care for him so much, you know. i wish the war hadnt happened to him, ibara didnt take control of him, i just want him to live happily like a normal child. hes so genuinely smart and kind. if he still wanted to be an idol id support him. if he wanted to go into archeology id support him. just anything. my girl is so sweet he deserves everything in the world i know he will grow up to be wonderful no matter what he does and i want to be part of that journey with him.

> Who wouldnt want to adopt a silly skrunkly wunkly eppie yippe autism tbh transgender  wet cat that may or may not ate cement when he was three

## 22ND PLACE -- MADARA MIKEJIMA (13 VOTES)

> Can cook and clean, no need to take care of 🎀

> he has a huge cat motif so i think its similar to finding a cat in a box on the side of the road, and when someone finds one of those they pick it right up

> MAMA REVERSE PARENTIFICATION ARC. I'M GOING TO UN-MAMA HER. BE THE TEENAGER YOU NEVER FELT YOU WERE ALLOWED TO BE.

> mama is usually the one doing adopting so i would like to do the same for him 🙏🏻

> I want to show him the love his mother never gave him

> i'm his mama now. id treat him like my problematic son. he gets squeezy applesauce and twinkle toe shoes and a shopping spree at the local toys r us. he deserves it. he'd beat the everloving shit out of a kid in his very nice private school i enrolled him in because he saw the kid bullying someone and id just have to bat my eyelashes and donate more money at the next school fundraiser. my boy is getting an education. id take him to disneyland and he'd be on one of those leash things because i am taking no chances. he's everyone else's mama and i am more than ready to take on the responsibility of being his. id get a nice job with healthcare included so i can pay off all of the psychological help he desperately needs. id buy him a pony. id be the best mama for mama. a grandmama if you will.

> I like kids that go :3

> He’s got fucking disowned he’s sitting in a box in the rain sniffling…….. I’ll take him and take good care of him

> He's less of a wet cat but a stray I've seen for the past month surviving but not living. I feel bad cause that's clearly a domestic cat why is it outside with no owner and no love. I'm gonna adopt him cause he looked at me with the most sweetest lil eyes and chirped and I have no choice but to adopt him now even if he's a menace inside and breaks my flower vase. He's my lil pookie whether I like or not. I'm insane in the head

> i dont think i could fix her but fuck, SOMEONE has to try

> I would pay for her therapy

## 20TH PLACE -- LEO TSUKINAGA (14 VOTES)

> Leo. Leo has already once been adopted before in the soaking rain by sena. But.. I AM THE BETTER CARETAKER. 
>
> You see, it all started a long time ago.. when i found a box. It was cold and pouring and i saw the poor kitty in the box. I could tell he had a bright future ahead of him so i adopted him. Ever since that he has been an absolute joy. I wish he didn’t scribble with his tiny muddy paws all over the walls in our house, but i dedicated a room to him for him to scribble in. Sena can’t do that, because he’s mid (i produce him) this is why i am better than Sena. LEO?? WHAT ARE YOU DOING GET OFF OF THE STOVE?! Ah as i was saying, I would have adopted multiple but unfortunately i dont have the space for it, i already have enough trouble with Leo as you can tell. Dangerous kitty but what can you do… However when he’s not causing trouble he loves snuggling up on your face or in your arms when you’re trying to sleep. Sigh what a spoiled little brat, getting everything he wants because he knows he’s adorable and im weak to him.

> izumi canonically adopts him at the end of next door, so there's precedent

> if I saw him all alone in a wet cardboard box I think I would fall to my knees pick him up and bbring him home

> HES BEEN THRU SO MUCH ALREADY if I physically saw him alone and soggy and sad I would have no choice but to immediately start bawling and kidnap him into my jacket

> why does only izumi get a pet leo i want one too???? he can be a dog a cat a rooster bro's got it all what more do you want

> He has to be protected at all costs. Even Izumi agrees with me. He said himself he signed pet adoption papers when he started living with Leo. If Izumi says something honestly then that actually means something.

> Silly meow meow i will feed him cat food

> the world would be boring without his crazy ass

> he look like cat

> He's Leo. LEO. MY SON LEOKUN. (I'm so sorry my other sons Eichi, Wataru, Rabits, Ryuseitai, Valkyrie, Knights, 2wink, Switch, Eve, and my beautiful daughter Arashi T_T)

> all of knights is the definitions of wet cats in cardboard box but. leo. leo is the type of a cat who will cutely sit in the box with his paws out peeking at people with the :3 face and you would be like awww what a nice cat and you will take him home and regret your every decision in life bc this cat is chaotic as hell but very cute and clingy also so you like. alright. and just let him live with you.
>
> he probably just composed on the streets and it started raining and he saw a box with cats and decided to just sit here with them. so now you obligated to take the box with all kittens and some dude in it. he will compose a song about that after. silly orange cat.

## 20TH PLACE -- AIRA SHIRATORI (14 VOTES)

> He's just a little bean, a cute little potato, a floofy little kitten, he's baby

> i think hes very hamster. i will prepare the finest hamster cage i will watch him run on a hamster wheel and i will feed the upmost premium hamster snack. i will make him forget his sad lonely hamster days where the other hamsters used to laugh at him. and finally i will cradle him in the palms of my hands and think. life is not so bad after all.

> he looks like he was born in a cardboard box all alone. i don't even like aira but he's so pitiful id feel terrible if i didn't take him under my wing {"<"}/3

> she’s pathetic and i need to help her so ill adopt her and buy her whatever idol merch she wants

> he’s like my son already i’ll do everything for him i pomise

> we share the same interests so we would probably get along pretty well ,, i feel like hes the safest option tbh

> Look. I am rei sakuma kinnie. aira is my nasty little daughter. she’s beautiful and she’s wonderful but I have caught her suicide baiting people online so many times. I would purchase her so many things, I would take him to the mall and be like just go wild girl. I would surprise him with Taylor swift concern tickets. And when we had a disagreement he’d tell me to kill myself and mean it, but then come back an hour later and be like “sorry the moon is Aires :/“ and you know what? who am I to fight that. here’s a new phone aira

> think about it she's so adorable she'll literally make you a bagel at 6:32 am with jelly and butter on the side of something idk but like she can't be in that cardboard box all alone 😿 there's like no food or water or loona in the scary outdoors

> he's cute, he's adorable and he's also an idol fan just like me! love live aira {"<"}3

> Hes probs already crying and sobbing cause no one has given him a home. Also hes just baby

> my beloved...the skrunkly.....the onglydoople.... i will take good care of him. my beloved. light of my life. i would kill a man for him

> because he is just {"<"}33

## 18TH PLACE -- TOMOYA MASHIRO (15 VOTES)

> Tomoya is just the safest choice here

> he's a very good boy. i feel like if i adopted him i'd get clear skin and never get stressed. he's also the most normal one out of all of them i love him

> big, wet puppydog eyes with a somber smile. "please adopt me producer-san!" tomoya quietly says while shivering in the cold rain. you look at him with empathy since hes so cute ❤️ and pick up the box he's in and take him home. he says 'uwaa!?' like a cute anime girl 
>
> once settled down, he jumps up and down excited that he is now safe and warm! for as long as you let him live with you: he is respectable, does his chores, eats the meals, and gets you vip tickets to ur favorite idols preforming live. hes seriously the best option and im not letting my tomoyaP biases get ahead of me

> i know he can handle himself. but i wanna be his proud mom taking him to soccer practice and bringing him cut up fruit while he does his math homework.    and maybe then id have a shot with nazuna

> Who dares leave this little bunny all alone :( I will take good care of him

> he's wet, he's a rabbit, he's a theatre kid, he inspires such deep maternal instincts in me I never knew I had, I have to save him from Wataru, he's just a silly little guy, I want to dress him up in funny outfits and post him on my Facebook, he makes me want a Facebook, so I can be one of those mothers, he is my son, Tomoya Mashiro is my son and my son alone, I feel like I am going to split at the seams? Every card of his was actually taken by me and was prefaced by me calling him handsome and pinching his cheeks.

> HAVE YOY SEEN HIM. HE LOOKS LIEK A PUPPY  . TMOYRA MASHRIO. I LEO4V YOU

> hes soncoded

> A theater kid who has been through Wataru, Izumi and has been on a unit with Rinne can do anything if they try. Anything but going to therapy, which I will force him to do

> All rabbits can do is lead you into a dreamy wonderland.

> because i love him so much he's so scringle dingle. i would very much enjoy opening the door during a thunderstorm and seeing him and his little pathetic little soaked body inside an equally pathetic soaked cardboard box. i would adopt him and nourish him and take care of him everyday, though he would be treated less like a human and more like a little doll, similar to his niichan. i will give him gifts of grandiose and he will love lavishly, but everyday he will be reminded of his poor, boxed upbringing. he will be given everything in the world, all for the sweet and adorable tomoya mashiro, yet he will sleep in the same box he came in with, in the exact same place on the porch. even as it deteriorates and becomes nothing, that will be where he rests. when the box withers away, he will sleep on the concrete. i love tomoya mashiro.

> HE'S SO CUTE he's my little eepsy boy he's so adorable. he didn't get enough votes on this survey and you all will pay the price.

## 17TH PLACE -- TETORA NAGUMO (16 VOTES)

> Have you seen him. He’s the type that comes home n storms around the house pouting bc smthn happened at school but he doesn’t wanna talk abt it. The kind of kid I’d watch movies with where we talk during the entire thing & make root beer floats in the middle of the night are you joking. I’m scruffing him. Picking him up by the back of his shirt like a drowned kitten and putting him in my purse. If I ever catch him running around w his little fang I’m becoming a mother.

> as a trans person i want to adopt him to help him on his transgender journey. transing his gender through osmosis

> i will aid him in his quest to become the manliest of all men by allowing him to carry my grocery bags, refill my water bottle, and oil my rusty bicycle, and i will apply to good schools for various sport scholarships on his behalf as his legal guardians so he gets royalties and free gym passes to share with me (his legal guardian), and we will make lots of high protein meals together for manly muscle growth

> i called the ryuseitai juniors my sons once and i never recovered since then. while nobody's looking im taking all my other enstars sons n daughters i cant leave them there theyrmy babys...

> i already see him as my cute son, but also? if i was his mother [im a guy] i would not let him feel lonely or sad! i would watch anime with him and give him cute lunch thats shaped like hearts and i'd watch him grow into a fine young man and i'd be proud because i love my son .. and also kuro kiryu would be my wife while i do it

> idk much about enstars but my friends like them :)

> He’s my literal actual son

> Sweet lil baby

> i think he needs supervision have you seen him cook? ik kuro has already adopted him but this little dude needs as many parents as possible. he's such a guy

> If you saw a baby tiger in a wet cardboard box in the rain, would you leave it alone? No,,, you would not. So how is tetora any different? If you fight him, he will be your lifelong rival. If you are kuro, he will emulate you in the best way possible. If you adopt him, you can best bet tetora is going to spend the rest of his life trying to make u proud. He dealt with chiaki morisawa for gods sake. Tetora is the cutest and will 3000% obliterate anyone who wrongs you... What more could you ask for?

> i like heroin

> While he'd be happy being wet in the rain I still wanna adopt him my pukapuka son ipy mipy blublub spoungky doingky poopsy moopsy

> he’d just be so cute and say shit i’d feel bad to leave him alone bc someone would probably take him for ransom if i don’t

> He's the character that got me to check enstars out in the first place. Upon hearing about the way he grew up I wanted to hold him gently and cry. He is the blorbo for real. I want him to be happy. I will deadass move into a beachfront house just so my son can puka puka to his hearts desire. I am like a vampire when it comes to daylight I will gladly burn in the sun if it means I can see him live his best life.

> She is cute

## 17TH PLACE -- NIKI SHIINA (16 VOTES)

> I'm here for the free ☆5 food

> I love cooking but parents said I'm making poison. Adopting Niki would boost my confidence. Niki will eat anything I feed em, even the burnt laddle I accidentally left in the fire.

> great chef, i'd be eating 3 course meals everyday. would gladly accept cooking classes, but he'd starve fast too...

> Silliest known to man.Little guy.

> Puts him in my pocket with a little snack

> Expensive breed but relatively low maintenance

> he silly chef. you get yummy food and cute boy. WIN WIN

> if i saw niki soaking wet in a cardboard box i would take her to a loving home (my house) and care for her like she deserves (kill whoever put her in the box)

> It'd literally be like having a personal chef 24/7 even though he'd make me broke from the amount of food he'd consume, it's okay because he's pretty and nice

> i would eat all of her food like teah i would absolutely DEVOUR everything she cooks for me an i would love to make her happy and and jhAaassEWWAAAE

## 14TH PLACE -- TSUMUGI AOBA (17 VOTES)

> He would absolutely insist he is fine while bleeding from the leg covered in scratches and look like he doesn't know what the word shower means
>
> God knows I need to take him home because I know he's gonna make sure anyone would pick somebody else and he needs to be tough love yelled at to take care of himself so I have to

> I mean he’s a soggy wet cat in a cardboard box. Who wouldn’t want to adopt him. He’s just so pathetic someone needs to take him and look after him and I volunteer myself, and he’d be so thankful about it. Then I can just pet his hair all day

> i'm going to give her the best childhood ever. the one she never had. i'll brush her hair and she'll look at me with those shiny eyes inwould do anything for that. the most sopping wet cat character ever so not adopting him is not even an option for me i just care her so much

> just look at his big wet eyes and his pathetic demeanor. how could you leave him?

> HES SO SO PATHETIC If I see those big ole puppy eye dreanched in rain I'm doomed I'm bringing him home idc if he's older than me I'm wrapping this man in blanket and make him hot chocolate

> He's silly goofy and needs a good home like a stray cat

> They're all so adoptable, so i made my choice based on "scrunkly scrimblo"ness

> when you go to the animal shelter and think youre going to adopt a puppy but you see a older dog running around and he looks happy but something in his eyes just looks sad so u adopt him instead.
>
> This is like tsumugi except he is human and an adult man.

> Just look at this man, with luscious blue locks of pristine hair, yellow eyes that shine  brighter than the stars above, his voice a soft chime that resonates deeper than you heart. If your orbs caught sight of Tsumugi Aoba, sitting and shivering helplessly outside in the dreadful cold, with only a mere cardboard box to protect him from the harsh conditions of the true nature of the world we live in, you'd be a demon not to gently take his arm with your own, interlock his soft yet calloused hands with your own, and walk him back to what you would designate as your humble abode. After giving him your delicate attention and attending to his needs, preferably by offering him some green tea in a cozy mug that he can wrap his cold hands around, also weighted fuzzy penguin blanket. Any person with a heart would then immediately call up Miles Edgeworth and get those adoption papers signed faster than light. Congrats! Now you're a single parent with Tsumugi Aoba as your child. He deserves better parents anyways. Didn't Tsumugi say that his parents are like big feng shui believers and therefore if he dropped dead on the ground, then they'd just tell his corpse to move over because he's in the way? Now me personally, I wouldn't let that slide.

> He seems pathetically aoft and I'm going to put him in my mouth

> He’s soft and fluffy

> hes like the perfect son. hed do his homework, cook his own dinner, take care of himself, and still have time to do whatever he wants. very obedient little guy!!!!!

> He is so sad and wet and pathetic. And I would brush his hair for him because he clearly needs it

> i kin him and hes like a little wet dog in a box i would give him a second chance to be happy

> I almost picked my son Hiiro but. he can take care of himself mostly. Tsumugi NEEDS to be adopted and doted on until he gets some self-esteem!!! I will gently brush his hair and make sure he always has an umbrella before he leaves the house and remind him to not overwork himself. his family doesn't deserve him so i am his mom now and i am attending every switch concert and telling everyone i know about my cute idol son and his brilliant smile!!!

> This poor guy. The epitome of a sad wet meow meow. I want to feed him warm carrot soup and some ibuprofen and then maybe he'll understand what it's like to be normal.

## 13TH PLACE -- MAKOTO YUUKI (19 VOTES)

> Hamster… :-)

> idk if i'll be a good parent or anything but i can at the very least time travel back to when he was 5 years old so that he doesnt have to be the sole breadwinner of a household and walk himself to and from work everyday because his mom is too sick to properly supervise him and his dad is too busy playing revolving door with the prison system

> He is like a sopping wet cat in a cardboard box i would immediately adopt him if i saw him

> imagine makoto age 10 staring at you with those fugly green eyes and he proceeds to tell you how his dad just went to jail for attempted murder and the only person resembling a guardian around him is izumi sena. i would adopt him so fast he is my son

> He’s a silly little hamster who can do no wrong /hj
>
> But seriously he’d be such a sweet son to have. We both love gaming so we already have something to bond over, and he’s just so caring and kind and loving! He’s also fun to be around and I just know I would enjoy being his parent ^^ (i also own his nui and it’s like he’s my son and I love him sm)

> He is just a cute little hamster and a gamer too! Least likely to rip up my furniture. All that I really need to do is Izumi-proof my house

> im going izumi mode

> hes literally a gijinka of graham from animal crossing how could i not. actual hamster of a man. i wouldnt put a wheel in his enclosure for enrichment id give him a nintendo switch with taiko no tatsujin installed on it instead

> very useful. who else would be a better candidate at grinding on runescape for me than the man himself, makoto yuuki of trickstar?

> I literally don’t even give a fuck about Trickstar songs n lore but I saw the card of Makoto as a lil kid n went “ High as fuck and this is making me emotional he looks so fucking cute ong”

> the card of him as a tiny would make me go awe he so tootsit and pick him up and then id shake him slightly and see if his brain rattles a little and then id just carry him into sunset and watch izumi jaw drop at seeing his yuukun being taken away [ because hes my son now ]

> who wouldn't want to adopt a cute little hampster walking on his sunny road

> if there was 51 enstars characters in cardboard boxes in front of me, i would, without a doubt, start searching for the makoto box. makoto is like a cute little wet cat in the rain he's so adorable and cute but also super pathetic and lame (affectionate) he's very adoptable and i would not hesitate to adopt him if i had the chance

## 12TH PLACE -- SOUMA KANZAKI (22 VOTES)

> Souma deserves to be adopted the most. He's so polite and he's 17-18 so now's the only time I can adopt him before he's aged out of the adoption system and he needs a family to be there and support him, especially since he doesn't seem to know how the world works and he needs to be shown how to interact with the world.

> i have already adopted him he is my son

> i have no idea why i even like souma, i just saw him and felt like yep i love him

> hes my pookiebear isnt she just the cutest thing i feel like i can be such a proud parent when i have him as a child hes such a good good goodest kid

> this may be diabolical but him being dependent gives me so much power… i could tell him to go kill someone and he would do if. ok but hes really cute.. im not a big souma fan but honestly hes prettier than 90% of the cast. back to what i was saying before if i were to adopt him i would be so superior.. idk… maybe theres something wrong with me or this is a kink.. if i saw him on the street i would run up to him and pick him up and hug him while spinning around.. id pinch his cheeks too

> his autism and transgender looks captivate me.. son review 10/10 very loyal and nice + epic sword since it comes with the package (souma) + When Souma Kanzaki was born he named his parents. His parents slept on Souma's bed whenever they had nightmares. When Souma turned 18 his parents moved out. Whenever Souma is late everyone apologizes for being early. Teachers were taught by Souma. Whenever Souma crosses the street cars look both ways. Whenever Souma tells a lie it automatically becomes the truth. When Souma is wrong the Universe rearranges itself so that he is correct.

> Idk he's just so precious to me,,,, i want to put him in my pocket

> he's like a sad wet cat, but a great one! he's the cat version of Let Me Do It For You~ and he's just very lovely. Can't wait to play dress up with him

> My beautiful son he would cook food and care for me in my old age. He would engage me in enstars analysis discussion when I go senile. He would mercy-kill me if the pain of living becomes unbearable. I would enjoy raising and sending him to college. Stream Summer Bird if we don't get it to 1 million views by its anniversary I'll kill myself in front of all of enstarstwt to permanently alter the trajectory of your lives.

> Souma :3

> souma is light and the love of my life. why wouldn’t I adopt this man ffs? she loves turtles (like me fr) so I can take her under my wing and I’d give him all of the turtle plushies she wants! and if I adopted her she could help we learn to cook bc I’m shit at it!

> cuz bro be gay just like me also bro can cook a mean dinner

> My son.

> Someone needs to show him that he can use his phone to watch turtle documentaries and I will be that someone.

> i would look at him and be captivated by his transgender looks and autistic personality. he would be sitting in a wet carboard box in a suspicious back alley, donning a fast food worker uniform and a variety of swords, and i would fall in love with this elegant being immediately. as i pick up his soggy form from the cold ground, Kaoru Hakaze who was born on November 3rd will leap from the darkness and be chased away by my beautiful child's katana. a horse would fall from the sky, killing me instantly.

> He is a lovely little man you see… he may threaten people with his sword (AHM EICHI AND KAORU) but he was in the right! I vow to take him in and support him and give him all the love in the world because that is what he deserves!

> so have you ever stumbled across a someone so skrunkly that you want to put them in your mouth and just hold them there so they're kept warm with your saliva and cannot escape because your teeth trap them there? yeah thats souma to me. he is already my son i swore to protect him with my life, my daddy instincts pop up whenever i see souma and therefore, i believe that i want him. (also i'm like super duper cool why wouldn't he want me as his dad)

> he is so pure so innocent so caring i wanna take him home

> adopt"? ah, I remember now. It means that I, Kanzaki Souma, must protect it to the end...!

## 12TH PLACE -- RINNE AMAGI (22 VOTES)

> grown ass man idgaf i’ll pick him up from the streets and treat him like a princess

> he's canonically a wet cat in a cardboard box all alone

> Because

> self explanatory

> he fun

> i want to see what niki saw in him

> I just saw him in the box and I felt bad. Also I recently finished the main story and Rinne tore me apart

> when niki shiina said he found him in a wet cardboard box all alone, yeah i just want to see that too

> Niki adopted him and succeeded. 
>
> He'll repay what he believes to be 'debt' and I'm set for life. (i love him i swear)
And I'm pretty sure Hiiro will be mailed to my address with some delay and I'm getting two for the price of one. That's a steal

> He's literally adopted by niki

> rinne is literally a wet soggy cat on the side of the street no one understands please. hes so soggy

> I am talking about pre crazy: B Rinne. That's right, the Rinne who Niki found on the side of the road. He is literally born in a wet cardboard box incarnate. I'd like to adopt that Rinne due to the fact that he's still probably full with childlike wonder with the new world he is introduced to. He escaped to the city for the purpose of following his dreams and I'd love to help him learn more about the world, be it economics, culture or how to use a microwave. He is my son, my grandson even. I'll teach him how to use an ipad, and he will teach me resourcefulness with nature around me, like how to shoot a fruit from a tree. My son.

> i have never played enstars once in my life he’s just a cutie pie

> he is nothing more than a sopping wet kitty cat. just as niki did i can pick him up from the wet cardboard box he lives in and take care of him. she gets apple sauce on sundays and we go to arcades together until he gets his hand stuck in the ticket muncher. will be so cute 🥺 also rinne n me indigenous solidarity lets go

## 10TH PLACE -- MAYOI AYASE (26 VOTES)

> my meow meow who deserves to be pampered and loved ♡ i will keep his enclosure so clean and full of enrichment toys (tatsumi and shinobu nui) and feed him 3 meals a day of grape jelly ♡ i will brush his hair and surprise him with art supplies and diy kits to play with ♡ he will do funny little dances and i will lure him out of dark corners with photos of aira sleeping ♡

> you can mostly leave him to his own devices. your house will likely be protected from burglars and shit. he'll know if anything's wrong with ur house bc he's crawling around in the walls all the time. hear a weird unexplainable noise? its probably just mayoi!

> I will save him from his wet cardboard box stuck out in the rain and give him a warm blanket and feed him menudo

> HonestlyJSBVJ Mayoi is why i got into the game and to this day i squish him with love. He deserves the world and id happily die for this little freak(affectionate)

> leave soup and pepsi on counter and he comes out at night to eat it

> He's like a kitty cat, I want to pet him and give him love

> little kitty meow meow she deserves all the love in the world

> i need my little autism monster to be happy i will make her so happy mayoi worry not i shall feed you soup and give you bowls of ice cream. also if anyone if cruel to you i will hit them with the Biden Blast. my tootsit my skrunkle dunkle my oimbly my lil meow meow my babykins my pookie bear he is a sopping wet baby with big round eyes that was left in a basket in the rain and i am a woman who desires children but is unable to have any of her own, but has so much love to give and i will hesitate, wondering if he is truly alone, but his cries will force me to move and i will raise him gently, making sure he knows that i love him endlessly. i will give him all that i can and i will raise him with the hopes that he will be kind, and that he will have courage. he will be my sun, my moon, my stars. he will be my light, he will be life itself, a gentle but firm breeze in my ship's sails when i drift upon the waves, the call of the forest animals when there is peace, a firm warning when they go quiet. he will be love in and of itself and i will hold him dear for as long as i can. he will be my son, and i will love him dearly.

> i just wouldnt be able to resist his sad eyes . hes so so sad. sad little fellow  :(

> i want to adopt mayoi not as in like, adopting a child but more like finding a sad wet cat outside and carrying them to ur house. i wanna give him warm tea and blankets and brush his hair.

> Though I can barely take care of myself (I made my chocolate milk explode a few days ago while making it 😭 /srs), I'd would definitely allow him to reside in my home!! We'd get to ramble our favorite things and I'll make sure to make him feel safe and comfortable in my residence!! Plus I'm sure he won't mind if I present to him my collection of LPS toys and beanie boos plushies 💞💞

> He's like a little cat, I would adopt him and take care of him and watch him hide inside my walls

> Idk I just want to put him in a jar

> She's a silly wet little kitty :3 theres no reason to not adopt her

> i want to baby her cuddle her take care of her

## 9TH PLACE -- TSUKASA SUOU (29 VOTES)

> just a cute little guy, i want him to spoil him with all the sweets he wants

> Sopping wet cat that has consumed ants before. I need to take her in before she starts eating more insects. Unless she wants to take care of my ant infestation.

> that's actually my son

> someone needs to stop her from eating ants

> I will feed him sweets. We will cook sweets. He’s funny to look at

>  he's my scrunkly, I love him, he's so cute and precious. He can be really silly at times but it's okay he's still my little guy, i'd gently hold him in my hands, I mean why would you not want to adopt someone who whales in card games !! He also has cute red hair !!! He also likes dessert !!!! Come on !!! 

> felt silly also because umumum idk!! hes just my son .

> she is so cute I want to squish her and give her parfaits

> this child is a sheltered AND repressed rich kid. he is not surviving a day out homeless. alas i must take him under my roof so that he isn’t attacked by rats or poisoned from eating suspicious ants

> today is another day where the sun is fucking shining only because tsukasa suou was created by fucking god himself because its impossible to achieve this level of perfection if youre a mere human its literally not possible to do this in a human way because you nred some kinf of powers to be able to create a criatura that is so powerful that can fix leo and have character devoopment at the same time its completely impossible for a human to create such a beautiful and pure and precious being so everyone say thsnk you tsukasa suou for making the world have lightining and sun and warmth today

> hes so cute idk he deserves sm better i can brinh him up better than the knights can

> Whether it's a cat or a kid, it's obviously Tsukasa, he'll be the most behavest and rebel kid/cat and I'm totally fine with cause it's still Tsukasa

> tsukasa suou is my goofy silly boy, I love him and his bad puns
>
> and I might suddenly have 5 kids all of a sudden

> he is so unbelievably son shaped
>
> longer, more detailed response (sorry): tsukasa is just so earnest and sweet, always trying his hardest, always looking out for other people. anytime he does anything, the older sister instinct takes over and i just want to wrap him in a blanket and give him some hot chocolate. he's just a good boy doing his best and while i admire that i also think he probably needs like a pat on the head and maybe a person to look out for him in a parental fashion every once in a while. he's capable and mature but he's also just a kid who is taking on a lot of work (leader of knights, head of his family, going to high school, I could never do all this imagine the workload) and i just want to sit him down and go "you're doing great buddy, maybe take a break every once in a while." i think that sudden death showed that he isn't always sure of his own decisions and doesn't really feel like he can talk to anyone about it so while i think tsukasa is more than capable of doing amazing things, he could probably also use a little bit of guidance (i'm so so sorry you had to read all this)

> Skrunkly

> He's the babiest baby to baby

> THAT IS MYYYY SILLLYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!

> he's like my nephew. i want to take him out for ice cream and ask him about his day at middle school.

> his autism and pathetic boy swag have captivated me

> nono the real question is WHY SHOULDN'T I !!!! my son. my daughter she deserves the world ....... I'll give her the best treatment she could ever imagine and I'd give her. ice creem

> Imagine the first word Tsukasa says to you is "Onee-sama". I would just be crying tears bc that would be the sweetest thing I ever heard. Also he's such a gentleman that it would be hard not to ignore him. ❤👑⚔❤

> he is jes a lil boy... i wanna give him a buncha candies an take him t all the cute cafés he wants {">"}:3c people re mean t him way too much an it makes me sad so i wanna spoil him!!

## 8TH PLACE -- MITSURU TENMA (36 VOTES)

> W character + would be so grateful + would be your biggest supporter in anything ever + gets the zoomies + best friend material + deserves the world and everything good in it + mitsuru tenma

> well behaved little boy just give him bread and take him out for walks

> live laugh love bread :3

> The only reason I'm adopting mitsuru is to get rid of that ugly ahh haircut he got. Whoever did his haircut I hope they know where their final destination is. I am disgusted, appalled even, in whoever cut his hair. His barber had to be blindfolded because there's no good explanation for such a haircut. He must've got his haircut done in a dark alleyway at 3:35AM in new york by a lawnmower. I know he looked in the mirror and tears ran down his face, knowing he done fucked up. And what bothers me the most is that nobody says anything. Nobody tells him the truth. They all lie to him, saying he's adorable when truly he looks like he just got jumped and now his hair messed up. I don't care if I must shave all his hair off, anything is better than whatever he got now.

> He awakebs my big sibling love i need to hold his hand before we cross the road so we both can run because im not responsible either and im ready to enable his chaos

> my little snack boy my favorite little man ohhhhhhhh he loves a bread. i love Bread Too..

> He's legitimately my child already, where do you think the hyperactiveness came from????

> he is a silly little banana. what a sweet boy, he will be my son.

> Wonderful little ray of sunshine we will destroy the bread economy together. Most enstars probably could’ve grown up in a better environment but like I dont think i can provide it so i will adopt the sunny dashiedashie bnuuy :)

> he is just so little brother idk how to explain it like i wanna put him on my shoulders and pretend to fly around with him and like race in the grocery store who could get to the end of the other aisle fastest and fight over who gets the last piece of bread and what not hes just so squishy

> Even if I don’t he’ll dash dash dash to my address 😨😨😨

> dash dash *star*

> I think he's the most good boy that I ever know whatever it's gonna be kinda tiring to take care him with all his big energy but I like him to be my son cause he such a sunshine

> he reminds me of a raccoon dog or a tanuki? if he misbehaves then i’ll just pick him up by the collar and take him home

> He can’t dashdash~☆ in the rain!!!

> my broke ass can only afford bread

> dash dash dash

> He’s a wholesome bread loving boy. The kid makes me smile.

> he looks like a puppy who would steal my bread but actually i don't mind cuz he looks so cute

> i would like to dash dash , so true mitsu

> I don't know why he just is?? he's so cute I would buy him all the bread he wants

> little cousin😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭

> i just think he's neat (:

> Joe is more than just a hungry man. He is starving and utterly famished, yet he still finds time to record, edit, and upload his videos on YouTube. He is so incredibly passionate that he ignores the ache in his stomach and pushes on to upload these videos for our enjoyment. We should be so very grateful to this man and his cause. I have such extreme love support and loyalty Joe is hungry and you should too. Because no he's not just an elderly man who lives in Georgia, he is a man who is HUNGRY! HE IS... JOE IS HUNGRY.

> He loves bread (so do I) he loves Ra*bits (so do I)

> My little meeple….. so skrunk…. So tiny….. my little sopping wet kitty… my meow meow… ♡

> putting my love for mitsuru aside (definitely for sure) he'd be like having a dog but in human form !!!! also he needs is munching and dashing aka food and walks !!!!! i give him bread, he happy. i let him dash, he happy. i introduce him to his ra*bit pals he happy. a close close second would be shinobu bc i legit almost cried seeing ur edit of him crying in the box and i just want him to be happy and nin nin :,{">"}

> my adoptive son that i birthed. Me and my dear wife (arashi) would take good care of him and buy him all the bread he wants and give a big ass lawn that he can dash dash on. I'll give him some conchas too because I think he would like it and I am mexican 🤞🏾 i will also get him the new jeans McDonalds meal if he so desires

> hes so silly so skrunkly i would hold him like hes a little wet cat in the rain :,3 hes so eepy /affectionate

> He's just a good boy! He cares so much for his friends! Even though he's ADHDs poster child and not that good at his classes, I'd want a son like him 😔 He tries his hardest and thats all that matters 😭

> I can and will bake bread for him. Also id be forced to exercise chasing after him ♥️

> This silly goofy kid will definitely run away from me the moment I forgot to feed him croissant from that particular store that only sold at particular days, but he's so cute that I won't mind running around for hours chasing this fast midget.

> I will feed him bread from my freezer

## 7TH PLACE -- TORI HIMEMIYA (43 VOTES)

> fucking tiny

> tiny

> little tiepsny

> She's just a little puppy, I'd scoop her up and take good care of her {"<"}3 He deserves so much love 💘 Very silly too! /p /pos

> he would beat my ass when i mess up his snacks but it’s ok. he’s teenmy and pink i can forgive him

> I Wanna own a cute pink thing but also if I adopt a tori She will come with a yuzuru and I like yuzuru.

> if she stared at me with those big eyes while in a wet cardboard box I'd actually think she's a kitten at first and then end up with her as my child :3

> my son he is siiiick

> i can't even believe he would end up in a cardboard box

> he is just a tiny pink bitch named breakfast

> shes literally just a baby .and comes with a bonus of a full of money bank account

> she brings a sort of "why does she not know this" vibe to the family dinner conversation that i would enjoy running along with

> I'm adopting him

> If there’s more than one option, Shu, Mika, and Tori would definitely be adopted by me. (I love my scrunklies)

> small and cute... will likely bite my fingers but thats ok :)

> I kinda have some sort motherly figure thing going on so adopting fictional characters (or friends lmao) is kind of a habit to me. So naturally i adopted some in enstars. Tori, Tsukasa and Shinobu so far. But im choosing Tori because he was the first one i ever adopted. My first ever favorite character, too. When i first saw him i was immediately like "He's literally Venti (from genshin) with pink hair", and since i love Venti, i also immediately went "okay. This one is my favorite. My new son. I will protect him with my life. I would do anything for him." And to this day it still stands. Tori is still my adorable and precious child that i love very much and i would die for him

> She was born in a wet cardboard box all alone . Poor thang

> tori is like a little wet cat in a cardboard box i can’t not adopt him.

> I just really want to dress him up and nurture him. I like to imagine he's like a little kitten. He makes me want to learn how to knit sweaters and style hair

> tori is my son. i adopted him 60 years ago when i found him on the streets in a wet cardboard box. i was given the option to adopt tori, the aoi twins or koga but i couldnt choose so i adopted all four of them but tori is secretly my favorite son and i dont plan on telling any of them that. whenever i buy my children gifts, they all receive 2-3 gifts. tori receives 5 because he is the favorite child. koga dont look pls i love you just as much. hinata and yuta dont look either pls. i did not say that tori was the favorite child i love you sons.

> Shes a pink and named breakfast! 💗 i love her we both have npd too ig

> Part 1: I would do anything for Tori. This is not a joke. If Tori needed both of my kidneys I wouldn't even wait for the blood test I would rip them out of my body fully awake and give them to him. 
>
> Part 2: Tori is the smallest and the pinkest and that makes him the best
Part 3 (actual reasoning edition): Ayumu Murase Tori's actual human voice actor said the thing that was the most appealing about Tori was his character growth and he was insanely fucking correct. I think a lot of people get fixated on Tori that calls your faves cattle at the beginning of ! and if you stopped reading there that's valid but there is so so much going on underneath that. Just across ! he goes from hardlining the boccama persona to convince himself he's better than other people when he actually is terrified he's not as good as them to making!!! Friends!!!! And realizing the strength of others even though he was trying to distance himself from them before (admittedly mostly so he can become better than them but like, me too). And that was such a good arc, and you see his relationship with the rest of fine also grow and change so he's seeing them more as his peers instead of deities & trying to be seen as an equal by them, and just when you're like wow that was a great arc time for the new game where somebody else will be the main character of fine YOU REALIZE HE'S NOT DONE! The !! Christmas story that just came out in en is GAME CHANGING, it's Tori being on the other side of that admirational distancing that he put on Eichi in ! and actually doing something about it and closing the distance and being BETTER THAN EICHI AT IT GOD BLESS and then in the upcoming stuff he's untangling his feelings for Eichi, he's trying to assert himself as a student council force now that Eichi's absence has left a power vacuum behind, he's trying to establish new terms in his relationship with Yuzuru, he's doing it!!! All!!! And all of this amazing development and growing as a person is despite his CHRONICALLY ABSENT PARENTS WHO I WOULD THROW OFF OF A CLIFF IF GIVEN HALF THE CHANCE. He's already doing amazing with no parents. I can be better than no parents. Tori I'm speaking directly to you I'm not as rich as your parents by a longshot but I'm above middle class and gay so I won't have any bio children to compete with you. Please be adopted by me. I will also adopt your sister so she doesn't have to get ritualistically sold via arranged marriage. I WILL BE HOME FOR CHRISTMAS!!!!! PLEASE!!!!!!

> He believes in santa still and that sort of purity needs to be protected at all costs and what safer place is there than my arms. If i have to fist fight yuzuru then i will. Or we can coparent.

> Tori is just.  The humanified version of an atomic bomb and i think thats what people look for in a ccjild.  I love tori hes so squishy

> I DON'T CARE WHAT ANYONE SAYS HES JUST A BABYYYY

> Honestly it was hard to decide between Tori and Mika, so I randomly went with Tori. Tori is my son, if I saw this little marshmallow in a box outside I couldn't help but to take him home. He isn't even my favourite character, but honestly? Tori the world. Just because yes.

> My cutie patootie my squishy my sqimchy my scrimblo my blorbo Tori my absolute most adorable child I would spoil and love her so so so much, much much MUCH better than how the fandom treats my sweet lil Angel girl

> tori has cute little baby puppy eyes and he deserves the entire world i love tori he’s so cute he’s a little skrunkly, a little guy, very very silly

> He's a little guy!!! He's pink!!! He's adorabllee and so scrimply scimblo scrunkles {"<"}3

> poor baby wouldnt survive 3 seconds out in the cold and no one else will take him because eng fandom doesnt like him for some reason??? he is the cutest being on this earth
>
> he wont take up much room in the house he is only 3 chicken nugget sauce packets long

i'd buy him the fanciest most expensive cat tower to play in and climb and sleep in, but he'd ignore it completely because he would just want to cuddle up close and get head pats all day 🥺

he's the epitome of "that special feeling when a cat hisses and hates every living soul that comes near him except you"

i just love him a whole lot

> listen to me. tori. he can be kinda whiny sometimes and people do not like him but i do. i like him. and i willadopt him he will be my beautiful son. i will buy him thousands of christmas presents and stay awake all 24 hours of christmas because tori himemiya loves christmas i will even buy him an eichi tenshouin 30ft cardboard cutout. maybe if i adopted him yuzuru would kill me or something but like ill marry him and then we have shared custody or something i am not opposed to marrying yuzuru fushimi but tori he is my soggy wet cat in a cardboard box my shining star my son. i just love him really bad i got 5 copies of his branco card on engstars and hes so cute. i think i would take care of him well he can run all of my credit cards

> if i could, i would adopt tori n hajime together. they are bonded little wet kittens DO NOT SEPERATE THEM!!!!!!!

> THATS MY FUCKING DAUGHTERRRRRRRRRRREE maybe it’s because i’m a hiyoriP who is also a big eichi fan. but tori is my daughter i love her so bad she’s so cute and sweet and mean and tiny and perfect and has grown so much as a person and i’m very very proud of her for it and whenever i hear her voicelines during songs i feel like the 🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹 emoji and also the compilation of gumball crying and also the video of lois family guy running through a jungle PEETAHHHHHHH you know? also an amazing voice when i first listened to owaranai symphonia i looked around like You guys are letting the thing the size of an ant with fetus-colored (cr. eichi) hair outsing you all? she is very dear to me. i would happily make her cute little lunches AND SEASON THE FOOD (@yuzuru) (sorry yuzuru i like you yuzuru) the first time i saw the branco unbloomed i felt like expl0ding myself and the building i was in

> i would give up everything i have to make tori happy.

> I want to pick him up and squish him a little but not too much so it hurts, i want to give him a lil pat and watch as he goes :3 he is the light of my life my son my beautiful baby boy he is my everything tori himemiya is life itself. without tori i would be living on the freeway in a cardboard box, whenever I hear toris voice my soul leaves my body and is replaced by a purer being. if i was toris parent i would treat him so well i would be the perfect parent always making him the tastiest lunches and squishing his cute lil cheeks. id tuck him softly into bed and give him a lil smooch on the forehead and smile fondly at him as he falls asleep peacefully. id enter severe debt just to give him what he wants and what he needs. when he wants to kiss boys(tsukasa) i would accept him for who he is. id be there for him on christmas... and id come to all of fines live and sit in the very front cheering my beautiful son on, making sure he knows how much i love him. tori is such a wonderful little boy and I love him so much, he is truly the perfect son and I love him so much. hes my lil pookerdookerz scrunglie popper pookie

> just so id get to face the wrath of fushimi yuzuru when he sees that ive stolen his beloved  bocchan (the bloodlust in his eyes are utterly sexy)

> This little pink demon IS my son. He is 5 seconds old and his first words were "I LOVE OWARANAI SYMPHONIA". I think I am raising him quite well. He has already learnt how to dance and sing. I am so proud. I cry tears of happiness every time he hits a little jig. I love, my son, Himemiya Tori. He has rabies, but he doesn't bite me. He only bites strangers, I support his actions. He hasn't done anything wrong in his life ever, but that's probably cause he's just turning 20 seconds as we speak. *Insert sniffling for dramatic effect.* I will now go back to assisting my son, thank you.

> id feel sooo responsible of his fate if he looked up at me. if i ignore him, years later ill think about going to get groceries and his face will pop up in the back of my head and i will have to curl up into a ball and cry and throw up and wonder for hours what ended up happening to him

> he's a tiny little bug and i gotta protect him (yuzuru might hunt me down. that's ok)

> He just so silly❤️

## 6TH PLACE -- KOHAKU OUKAWA (52 VOTES)

> out of everyone in c:b i think kohaky would be the most manageable! and she’s also the cutest so i would be more convinced to pick her up off the side of the road

> Hes literally my squinkus. Sopping wet fucking cat who will scratch my face off if i dont give him his treats. Cute pink kitty cat. I love you kohak youre already my son.

> she doesnt even know basic math. i need to adopt her so i can teach her. and let her be a free buzzy bee flying about this world.......

> he is pink. i would like to save him from the wet cardboard box prison

> Sad little wet cat in the rain .. No one to love her, this sad cat in a soaked cardboard box .. Raining .. It is raining and she is drenched, this sorrowful little cat .. Soaked and drenched cat, sopping wet little cat in a little wet cardboard box .. Wouldn’t you adopt her too,?.. Don’t let it keep raining on this little cat .. She’s soaking wet from the rain this is so sad .. You have to adopt her .. I have to adopt her .. No more soaking wet box. Nice clean lovely home , warm little bed No more soaking wet cat . Happy little Kohaku cat frolicking around So so happy

> i feel he needs a new home, and i would treat him amazingly, in this hypothetical situation i feel he’d more be my younger brother since im a bit too young to be his motherfather but i would wake him up every morning to give him his breakfast in bed with a hug and a kiss on the forehead, then id get his clothes ready for school (which i enrolled him in) then after he gets ready make sure he is looking perfect, i’ll make him a fresh breakfast of his favourite foods no matter the price and pack it in his favourite lunchbox in his favourite backpack, when he comes home ill already have his clothes of his choice out on his bed fresh out of the dryer and ask him what he wishes to do today after school, we will do whatever he replies with then i will get him his favourite meal for dinner, our fridge and pantry are always full of his favourite food and drink, despite being his older brother id still treat him like this due to our hypothetical parents being busy at work to pay for us to relax and have fun. he will be happy and greatful of his new life and id also give him a cute nickname that he acts like is embarrassing but he secretly enjoys, we will be the best of friends.

> He brings out my grandma instinct. Everytime I see him, I'm like "oh my, what a handsome little guy you are! Would you like some candy, dear?" *grandma voice* i say as I pull candy out of my pockets and then I pinch his cheeks cuz he's so cute and adorable (idc if he'd kill me for it. It would be worth it)

> bingle bongle dingle dangle yickety doo yickety daa ping pong lippy tappy tuu taa

> I don’t mean to be a bitch but anyone who says a diff idol is wrong… Why do you think she has so many older sibling figures in ES? BECAUSE SHES THE MOST ADOPTABLE!! Her girlfail charm paired with her girlboss skills creates the weirdest little pink thing you could ever ask for. She’s just a loser girl who steals the heart of anyone who looks her way.

> other than kohaku literally being my daughter, I would love to adopt a kohaku. Kohaku would be tolerable to deal with. Even though my life is at risk i kinda see myself in her (ONLY A BIT) and i would eat her

> i just think its fucked that kohakus parents made him use a kyoto dialect. Its like forcing your kid to say stuff like "ay im walking here" while living in Oregon . and the stuff about being trapped in a room

> ok i get that there'd be like 5 different idols fighting me for custody but i'll bribe him with all the japanese sweets he wants bc i like them too #parenting101 also i just think he's neat

> i would absolutely adopt a littel bingus in a little cardboard box :3

> my precious son he is so little brother coded

> I firmly believe Kohaku is one of the less high maintenance idols on this list. Also he’s adorable and loves sweets and is pretty witty, so he’d be a fun child to adopt as son. Then from his background I just wanna give him a more normal life to be able to experience the nice little things he might have missed out on. Also he’s like a natural home security system.

> He pink

> honestly the oukawas are great but damn id adopt kohaku just to spare her from some of the trauma

> He’s pink

> hes literally the only one younger than me other than aira. but i dont want to adopt a chronic idoltwt user

> Because he is my little mipy, I want to kiss him on his little forehead, make him a cute little dinner, like little sandwiches in the shape of bees for him, get him ice cream and tuck him in to bed. that is my son, he will always be my son, no matter how old he gets.

> she'd stare at me with her big autism eyes and lame attitude and i would be physically unable to deny her to come home with me. she  might bite and kill people but everyone is a bit quirky, i can work with that.

> I like pink haired guy..

> he was born in a wet cardboard box all alone

> Mama would try and stop me but then Kohaku would be like "you're not my mother" which would send him into a depressive spiral and Rinne wouldn't care and think its funny, actually, that Kohaku would get adopted for real so realistically he's the easiest to get out of all the younger guys in the cast. Tsukasa I would just push over if he tried to stop me.

> I can’t tell if I’m supposed to adopt a pet or a child but i think kohaku would be a good guard dog. She would one of those tiny but aggressive chihuahuas and would bite any intruder on my lawn (i have no lawn)

> he’s like a really cute evil baby. its like he was born from a woman and a man at the same time. not even joking i would like to adopt him so i can teach him about the world and the tax system. also he can make pizzas he would be great help at home too

> i want to squish his cheeks like a stress ball

> my little schmoopy i want to take him to burger king

> Idk, he's such a tsudere guy who won't admit he deeply cares for his friends. Also I did this out of boredom but it was fun. Tbh, I'll adopt the entire Crazy:B, lol, I really can't decide and we will need a Mama to help me look after the Crazy:babies😂 because SOMEONE will make a ruckus running away to the pachinko. Mama and Mamabee can make us dinner. Phony (if you don't know it's a song), Dango and I will go to the therapist, we need to know what are we doing we our lives.

> everyone who lays their eyes on kohaku for five seconds immediately become his big sibling there's no escape. he's very small and full of aggression and Little Brother Charm. he's also very pink. i hope to join the rapidly increasing number of sibling figures/parental substitutes. when the number grows large enough, he can finally achieve world domination {"<"}3

> TINY BABY🥺

> kohaku has been adopted in several instances (mama and crazyb) that should be enough proof that he's the unanimous candidate!

> My son… (ㅅ´ ˘ `)♡

> I chose him because he is my son. And I never choose anyone over my son. Kohaku Oukawa, the babiest baby boy assassin. He is the best boy. (Honestly i wouldve chosen kaname if he was there but we dont talk about that.) Literally Kohaku how could u ever resist him, I could forward you to tsukasa to continue on why Kohaku is worth adopting. 1. Literally so adorable you cant resist him. 2. Hes pink, his hair is pink how can u not like pink what the hell 3. Kohkohkoh, what the fuck is that laugh thats the most adorablest shit ever. 4. I want to make love with his mother (madara mikejima) if he knows i saved Kohaku he would want to marry me. 5. You have yourself a free bodyguard. 6. Did i mention that he was cute 7. His cousin is also cute I love his cousin tsukasa suou of knights loml literally and he would feel indebted to me amd he will fall inlove with me if he also finds out that i adopted his favourite cousin (delusional) 8. Its fucking kohaku oukawa have you seen him? Oh my god. 9. I will show off to everyone my son and that hes a walking nuclear bomb about to explode. 10. I kin him so

> He's been adopted like four times so that's gotta count for something

> he's the cutest edgy pink boi + I'd like to die in my sleep

> i understand tsukasa’s obsessive older sibling tendencies deeply. i need to mother this thing

> Ive already claimed him as my son when I first saw him so im just seeing this as me picking him up after school (I would let him go) in the rain and he looks like a furless wet cat and he angrily tells me im 10 minutes late when really its just 5 🙏🏽

> his indescribable little bro powers. everyone who lays their eyes on him wants to adopt him. hes so cute and small and does his best always

> He is my little guy. I will put him in school and spray him with a water bottle to make him stop murdering and hanging out with cowboys.

> polite and si lly  :-)

> The scrunkly. The little. The small baby. The precious. My beloved. Look at him, his precious eyes shining up at you. He'd be able to protect your home from robbery!! beat the crap out of them fr!! He has manners and is polite if you don't piss him off!! Would help around the house and go to school. He still acts like such a child at heart cmon you can't resist his cute little. He would look so cute when discovering something new like the claw machine card. I just want to affectionately squeeze him until he explodes. His parents literally locked him up he deserves so much better.  Kohaku deserves better. I'm not saying it should be me who adopts him because I'm a trainwreck, but he deserves better then being locked up and isolated. Kohaku my scrunkly my beloved.

> emotional support pink thing, he already got adopted by 4 people whats one more

> He’s a scrunkly little tomato and I love him with every fiber of my being. Also he can kick ass, is a very good protag, and the way he always says “im dumb” makes me wanna squeeze him even more. Baby, you are not dumb, you just have a lot to learn, pls never say that again—

> he is my son

> I think she needs a better family ok she might be an assassin but she's cute. ok. I will teach her how to be normal

> that is. a meow right there

> hes just a little guy! hes had a hard life and i think i could make up for that by getting him one of those pink princess beds with a canopy. let me set you a scene. its 6 AM on a monday morning. i feed him a nutrient rich breakfast and give him filtered water. i take him to pilates with me in a carrier case. we have a blast. all my friends love to have him around but they give him space cuz theyre chill like that. he gets treats for being a good sport. 
>
> he lives his best life. hes a pedigree pomerianian.

> he's cute.. pink thing

## 5TH PLACE -- HAJIME SHINO (59 VOTES)

> ik there's a lot of discourse going on on enstwt buT CAN WE PLEASE ALL AGREE THAT HAJIME IS CUTE, if not the cutest. I want to adopt this child because he's just so so adorable and makes me want to spoil him. Plus i could adopt his siblings too. Big family happi

> hajime is one of the few enstars character that would actually respect me as a parent

> I'm not responsible enough to take care of a child. Hajime is responsible enough to take care of himself. If I adopt him, he will be the one making sure I don't cause a fire at home.

> Hajime invokes the same emotion in me as seeing a little bunny snuggling

> Shes very sweet and I think we would like talking abt tea together :]

> she is the skrunkle the mipy the ittle i want to pat her she is my daughter jimenyan . our saviour our our rabbit meow .

> (not negotiable 😒) I'll spoil Hajime everyday if I adopt him and every night I will devote my whole life into raising Hajime. I will give him everything he wants I will protect him from even the slightest paper cut and if he cries I will initiate a whole live performance so he will stop crying and will smile again. and if I will cry Hajime will pat my head. I will take Hajime all over the world when I'm raising him. I'll never get mad at him, hypothetically, if our house somehow gets burned down because I left him at home I'll just say "Oh, it's okay, we all make mistakes,  I know you were just trying to have fun and you're still a growing little child so this may have been a very good educational life lesson for you" and we giggle as our house is burning down at the background. And when it's his birthday I'll make a gigantic cake with our faces in it handmade. And we would be BFFs and he will have the happiest life 🙏. And when he grows up after I adopt him I will support him in every way he can, and I will still dote on him as if he's a child even though when he's already grown up and that's how much I would love him if I adopted him (don't worry about the person that left him in the rain in a cardboard box because I would go after whoever left him in that state forcing him to beg a new home, but since I'm adopting Hajime I'll let that person off the hook to show a good example for him 😇) #This_is_ how_much_I'm_committed_to_Hajime {">"}:3
>
> Amen to that.

> free pet bunny who doesn't have to worry abt food costs

> i think he’s just a lil guy that needs a lil home.

> he’s such a sweetie I feel like he’d fill my life with good vibes. :)

> he's already like a son to me plus idk how to do laundry myself

> His eyes sparkle. It's cute.

> hajime's personality and design is adorable, her pretty face, her purple eyes and i just have a huge soft spot for blue haired characters. not to mention shes super caring and looks out for others {"<"}3

> This sweet precious bunny needs a home where he can doted on and swathed in luxury.

> He's just so small and scrunkly. Little baby boy, baby

> my Princess. Wee snookums. Im going to clean him like a mother Cat when i take him in and dress him up in cute frilly girl dresses.Darling Son

> Cute, low maintenance, well behaved rabbit. Won't chew your electric cords, promise. Can survive solely on bread crusts.

> i want to make him flithy rich lmao

> #HajimeShinoSweep

> just look at him

> Just. Look at him. Do I really need to explain? He's so precious and hard working and lovely and we could have little tea parties together. What more do you need to know he's my son now.

> I'm an (not so) old enstarrie (? In my mid 20s, and the first time I see him I was melting cause he is so tiny (still taller than me lol) and it makes me want to protect him, then I hear his voice and the parental side of me was screaming ;-; he's so precious, i already adopted him (⁠人⁠ ⁠•͈⁠ᴗ⁠•͈⁠) the more i know about him i feel more like a proud dad (? cause he is just so warm(? such a nice person (⁠ ⁠◜⁠‿⁠◝⁠ ⁠)⁠♡
>
> I literally want to adopt half of the cast but i have to admit that in this I'm really biased

> i just need a good younger brother and hajime seems just like the right one

> My son. My baby. I will adopt him. I will take care of him. I will feed him lots of miso soup(his favorite food). I will draw with him. I will stargaze with him. Drink tea together. Walk him to school if he needs to. I just love this little boy so so much. {"<"}3333333

> He was born in a wet cardboard box all alone :(((( hes so cute I want to hold him in my arms and tell him everything will be ok

> we both grew up poor as hell so i feel the need to protect her and make her happy. ideally i would create a scenario in which hajime does not have to eat bread crusts as a meal. i don’t even produce hajime lol but i love u i will protect u i will make U feel loved and raise your self worth
>
> *man yelling at cat in storefront voice* I’M GONNA GET YOU OUTTA THERE. I PROMISE YOU, I’M GONNA GET YOU OUT OF THERE.  YOU DON’T BELONG IN THERE.  I’M GONNA DO EVERYTHING IT TAKES!!!!!
>
> (context if unfamiliar lol https://youtube.com/shorts/FljGi6jzDmM?si=EnSIkaIECMiOmarE )

> he's literally a smol bun that needs to be comforted and hugged for 100 hours straight

> He's so tiny... I want to wrap him in the softest, fluffiest blanket. He deserves the entire world and I will do that for him.

> He is a sweetheart and he loves his family a lot LIKE, I THINK HE SAID THAT HE WANTS TO BE A FAMOUS IDOL JUST FOR MAKING HIS FAMILY HAVE A MORE COMFORTABLE LIFE?? He is just the perfect son, actually, I think everyone in ra*bits it's,,, like, they exist and go pyon idk, that's a very important caracteristic... Ukarete pyonpyon tobidete pyonpyon usagi de gozaimasu...

> Look at that sweet baby boy. He deserves the world. I would give him all of the nice things and keep him warm and safe. My sweet baby. I will knife anyone who hurts him.

> He is just such a good boy i love him i would give him anything he asks for but i know he would never be selfish and would ask to donate to charity or something🥺

> oh my god you know those youtube videos where people spoil their hamsters with like all these intricate desserts and cute little miniature kitchens hes so cute i would do that for him without a second thought 
>
> (youtube channel im referring to is vanillahamham AAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH cute)

> polite, obedient, low maintenance, knows how to save money, a good boy. who would be able to resist when he looks at you with those miserable eyes?

> He can help with laundry and stuff.. and he can make you tea like???? This boi is perfect to have in your house tbh also he’s pretty hajime shino best boi💗

> Genuinely feel like he would be a good kid and ilove him so much i love my skrunkly boo

> hes like little bnnuy…i want to hold him and give him treats … my baby son

> i think he would be so nice and polite

> he is very cute and tiny little baby

> hajime is a really well behaved kid i think, anyone else would burn the house down within the first day and am i financially stable enough to handle that sort of thing? no. at the adoption centre tho he would cry if he had to be taken away from tomoya so i'm bringing the both of them home with me.

> He’s the cutest enstars character

> i once saw a korean tweet that was like "how are mr and mrs shino poor? they gave birth to a child like hajime which is rarer than winning the lottery" and tbh they were correct. do mr and mrs shino know how lucky they are. how does such a perfect kid exist

> 30 petrol bombs would be sent to eichis home were i see any rabits members in a cardboard box in the rain

> hes mipy...

> OOOOH HES SO SPRINKLE!!!! SO SKIRNGLY DINGLE!!!! THR LITTLE NEOK BLUE HIGHLIGHTER HE IS SO SKTTLES FLAVORED.... I WANT TO SQUEEZE HIM AND TAKE HIM ON A WORLD TOUR AND BRING HIM TO SCHOOL EVERYDAY

> just seems like a very little wet pathetic cat. best for wet cardboard boxes. kind little pathetic generous wet cat

> like every other character is insane… hajime is nice ans sweet and i would like to buy her stuff as my child {"<"}3

> he's such a sweet cute boy. I'd adopt him and he'd be so thankful and start helping around the house too so that would not only be cute but very useful. Also I want to give him many headpats.

> lovely boy. light of my life. i would do more than just adopt him. I'll give eveything to him. it isnt even adoption anymore. my house? now his. my money? now his. there will be a point where all my belongings become his and i will be staying in the cardboard box instead. good. as i should be. I'll be happily living in the cardboard box knowing that the lovely boy is happy and well fed.

> Huggable

## 4TH PLACE -- HIIRO AMAGI (66 VOTES)

> i've already adopted hiiro and he's living happily with me and i make him lots of omurice whenever he wants :3

> He's like the singular bright ray of sun in the ensemble stars cast. He would listen if you told him to wash the dishes, he would listen if you told him to make his bed, he would listen if you told him to go wrestle the wolf that has intruded upon the vegetable garden. Even if he scratched the sofa or something he has great potential to learn which I feel like most of the enstars cast is lacking. Andddd he's smart so I wouldn't have to stay up until ungodly hours of the night tutoring him in school soooo slay!

> Small boy. Baby. Deserves to go to whatever the Japanese equivalent to Chuck E. Cheese is, and you think Rinne will do that? No. It’ll be me

> i love him dearly he is a great son we would go to the park and run and you bet i would willingly spend my life savings to get him anything i'd have to read his mind for ( he wouldnt ask for a thing) it's what he dserves. i love him

> i have a big bag of rice and a dozen eggs i need to get through,,lil omurice will save them from the trash!

> very polite little boy

> Wittle babu, teensie

> I will kill to defend my son. He's just a precious little boy always trying his best and has so much love to share for others. He's so sweet, just a little baby guy, who may be a bit oblivious but he's always learning and far more intelligent than what people give him credit for. I will adopt him and level the worlds of anyone who says anything bad about Hiiro Amagi. You will be struck down by my hand. Your world will become nothing except a barren wasteland. I do not care if he could easily restrain anyone who comes his way I will still gnaw through walls defending my boy

> he is so friend shaped he is just a little guy who likes omurice and goes umu and he *explodes*

> voy a escribir esto en español porque puede ser mucho pero bueno, rezo el traductor de Google funcione
>
> Hiiro es demasiado tierno y lindo, se ve como un gatito en una caja pero en un dia soleado y que te ve con esos tiernos ojos que no te puedes negar a nada, además de que es un sol y demasiado silly, soy capaz de quedarme en bancarrota solo para comprarle todos los omoriuse que quiera

> looks polite
>
> also he's just so... son-nable... like i want to cut fruit for him when he's up late studying and encourage his hobbies and pick him up from school in a minivan with pizza waiting in the back because it's gonna be our weekly pizza friday tonight! i guess rinne would also be my son depending on if the cardboard boxed idols have free will to gather their bags and go off on their own chosen path, but considering his adhd nyoom tendencies i think he would move out stat which is fine and i totally get because god same, i wish he would visit though because i would also love to have him there for pizza friday and to help him install shelves in his room and what not :')

> he's so precious the moment i adopt him he's gonna inherit everything in my will including my money, my life savings, my college tuition, my books, my nerf gun collection, my first born, my mansion, my car, my chocolates, my pokemon cards, ANYTHING he wants hell ill even go bankrupt for him, ill go homeless for him, ill do anything for my precious baby literally dont test me

> he is silly….. i want to show him fortnite

> So I picked Hiiro because I genuinely don't understand how can you see him and not immediately go "Oh my god that's my child" or alternatively "I literally birthed him". he's just so cute and I feel like if he was a little kid again he would deserve someone in his childhood (besides rinne) who treats him as a human being. I don't know if I can be a great mom cause I'm only 20 but I will give this kid ton of love and omurice.

> hes just a silly lil guy

> Baby very baby boy very smart baby but very baby red boy

> was going to pick hinata before i realized that that would take him away from yuta. do not separate them.

> When i first saw what this was about my brain first thought of hiiro. hiiro is such a cute boy i feel like if i saw him being so wet and soggy inside a cardboard box that he probably doesn't fit in i would feel my heart be so moved i might pass away. . . hes such. silly.. cutie... also i think he should come in a package as tetora. no other reason but bc i am a tetoraP and i think if they paired up ill have a heart attack /pos
>
> also hes very sweet and kind he'll try to return the favor of adopting him by being the goodest boy and being the best son and being the pride & joy of the bloodline despite being adopted

> He's a silly little baby, and I am his mom; if he gets sick bescause of the rain, I'll end myself-

> wide eyed red haired he looks very polite

> Is there a reason to NOT adopt Hiiro Amagi?!  Ever since I met this boy it's an immediate "I only known this 2D idol boy for a minute and a half but if anything happens to him I will kill everyone in this room then myself." He's the ultimate adorable lovable sunshine boy, I haven't seen a single person both in the fandom and in-game genuinely hate him and if there is, they are committing a universal moral crime! He's also the type who every parent would prefer more over than their own child. Your own parents might disown you just to adopt Hiiro!

> baby. i will show him the world. my silly scrunkmuffles. red. adorababy. shoudl i say more

> no idea, i just want to adopt him 😭

> He is the silliest little stupid. I want to take him home with me and make him yummy little snacks and put tv on for him and give him a nice warm blanket (motherly urges)

> if i were to adopt him as my child, i will dote him with the most luxurious stuff he will ever see in his entire life (which is an ipad. im poor.) he deserves the best. sadly hes gonna be fatherless but hey, at least he now has a new mom.

> he's just so cute and squishy and deserve sm love from the world

> I think Hiiro is just the perfect little brother, he knows karate, he studies well, he can even cook, he’s just an angel, you can’t be mean to that oblivious puppy face of his, i understand why Rinne have such a cute little brother so that’s why i need to bury him

> one time my friend said they would hit him with a train and i need to protect him from that *(son note: HUH???)*

> least likely to harm me

> Why can I only adopt ONEE 😭 I was thinking about it and, I wanted to adopt Hinata and Yuta, they need a real father, someone like me. But I can’t separate them I think I’d be some kind of monster.
>
> And then I was thinkin about mitsuru bc he’s just my little baby I’d come home and he’d be running in circles and he’s so cute he reminds me of like a little bug, his specialty being a backflip is so funny. Yknow when little kids call you over and over again and then when you do they just randomly spin? That but he just backflips randomly, he wants to eat bread all the time? Me too, I can afford bread. But then he has a happy family so like I’d check if he was microchipped before signing the papers and then they’d like take him back, like they left the gate open he ran out kind of thing, I’d be devastated I would have been attached by then. 
So then I’m thinkin like kohaku and then I’m like this kid would drive me crazy with worry he’d disappear right after dinner I’d go to tuck him into bed and he’d just be out killing people which is fine but like he wouldn’t tell me that’s where he went. I also don’t think I’m mature enough or qualified to give him therapy I’m so sorry king. Anyway I came to the conclusion that hiiro because he’s silly, also the fact that he was literally HOMELESS 😭😭 a baby!! Also he’s cute and he’s actually imo the best leader of any unit, idc,,, I’d feed him omurice all the time, I’d fight for a carton of eggs at the market, my family would love him he’s invited to the carne asada he’d get a silly nickname immediately, he’d be those kids I have to blindfold and spin like 30x before he hits the piñata and he’d still swing at the piñata and break it in one hit if he doesn’t knock someone else out first, he’s so sweet and wants to help people, I love helping people! He’d come home and be like mom I brought my friends and boyfriend over and it’s the most insane group of people and kohaku too so he’s still my son just son in law, but hiiro bc he’s so silly, a little guy, I love him! My son!

> not a problem child, good kid. respectful, well-mannered and will most likely look up to me 🥹 the only downside is his older brother but oh well 😄

> The idea of abandoning Hiiro is unthinkable. I wouldn’t be able to resist his sad baby eyes. I think he needs me.

> autism

> squishy little guy. im jealous that hes rinnes brother and not mine he just has perfect vibes i want to live with him

> hes just a boy and i love him (can i still marry his brother tho)

> he's precious holds him gently nothing bad should ever happen to him also my friend said she'd unwish childe on mudae if i vote hiiro so that's what made me pick hiiro over kohaku sorry kohaku i want childe more ... pats hiiro on the head gives him a warm blanket and a cookie

> hes so !!! spoinkly and cute i love himsoooo much i would adopt him in a heartbeat. i am also legally obligated to as rinne's wife

> babu; I'd feel like I'm actually raising a kid

> im kind of like starmaker productions ensemblesquare because i too would offer hiiro a nice cushy dorm room free food and lots of friends and make sure nothing bad ever happens to him ever again. he would go :D and fill my life with indescribable joy and every bit of hate in my body wld instantly evaporate

> Hiiro is best boy. A sweet little skrunkle, maybe the world's mipy ever. He seems so sweet and cute and innocent and pathetic. Who would not pity such creature.

> Hiiro is babie

> i want to heat him up in a microwave (he has shrunken down to the size of my pinky finger) and watch how hes spinning around in circles completely disoriented while hes puzzledly looking at me with his lil goofy gem like eyes thru the microwave door in a silent cry for help (i get him out of there just before he can explode and feed him tiny drops of water through a pipette, successfully making him look up at me with eyes full of foolish gratitude as he snuggles my finger while i try to comb his wispy hair with a toothpick)

> *lights my cigarette and wistfully takes a whiff of it* that kid… *chuckles charmingly* i took him in when he was but a chubby baby .. *smiles while looking down* you know.. the kind of creature you find on your bed when your mom has guests over..*looks away* when i first saw rinne describe him as a wrinkly baby i just knew he would fit nicely inside into a quadratic container.. wouldnt even complain about the lack of space. *briefly looks up to meet your eyes*  as long as he gets to eat his omurice made from eggs harvested by organic chickens that cost a lung. *smiles , this time a little more honest* when i first saw his infantile googoo gaga ahh eyes i just knew that i birthed this thing *clutches one side of my face like im in pain* yes. fuck. I am Amagi Mama. I died after giving birth to such a cute baby. His cuteness stole all the energy out of my already weakened body. the only thing i managed to tell my first born (his name is rinne. i hope hiiro grows up to mispronounce his name in a typical baby fashion. i hope rinne sees him take his wobbly first steps on his chubby little baby feet and thinks „Man. This is the cutest creature alive“  all while grinding his teeth in a futile attempt to not bite his baby brother in a fit of cuteness aggression. i hope they held weddings in the amagi village and people would make hiiros baby ass stand on a traditionally decorated table as he feels the beat in the way all babies do. by clapping and moving his knees up and down. do they have pacifiers there? did he suck on some flowers like some disney princess baby??) is that he should post this on twitter when hiiro reaches the age of 17 years. he deserves to know the truth. that i knew. that i, his mother, knew all along that he was made to fit into wet cardboard boxes the moment he left my body. but i knew i didn‘t die for nothing, the cuteness which my son’s eyes hold is enough to send an average victorian child into a coma Let Alone Win a Twitter Poll *fades away*

> SO UNRELATED BUT I THOUGHT A SPIDER MOVED BUT IT WAS JUST A PIECE OF HAIR TIE WITH MY HAIR ALL OVER. anyways hiiros just the scrimblo, he desurbs it.

> He’s the perfect little guy. He’s so sweet and probably the person I’d like to have as a family member the most. I would pull pranks on him and that tell him shit like he will go to jail if he eats my snacks and he would never see it coming and fully believe me until 10 years later. (I should never be a parent) but something about him just makes me wanna protect him :,3

> Okay to start it off, I see Hiiro as my otouto. He is like a little brother. He is the perfect little brother. So in terms of adoption, he is the perfect one to be adopted the most adoptable otouto known to man. Like he's an extremely handsome young man but also so extremely cute he has the perfect little brother/son vibes. He's so proud of who he is and he's very eager to learn things unknown to him and that sounds so fun?! Like imagine having a fun outing day with Hiiro and he already does have a lot of fun nature knowledge and all.. so you end up learning a lot from him too as well as a fun bond. And back in the city you can show him all the cool gadgets and whimsical city stuff that would get his large eyes to SPARKLE OUT WITH A FUN "UMU"! Plus he can take care of himself but also spoiling him would be so fun. Like yes I would gladly make him omurice everyday?! Plus omurice comes in so many types of forms with any kinds of toppings and things to add so it'll be a fun surprise for him every morning with a new type of omurice to fill him up for school! Besides he's so academically smart and all around great athlete and everything so you don't have to worry about his grades checks and everything. He's just overall amazing and he'd care for you too! I'd gladly accept his forms of remedies and care he's learned when growing up in his village! I'd be so happy and filled with love to know that's how he'd care for me if I were to be his caretaker. Hiiro is the best. I love Hiiro Amagi he is a son to me as well. I love Otouto more than anyone else, he brings me so many happy tears and I couldn't help but give him pretty silver jewelries and everything. He's quite the best, he's the most amazing person ever. He is the prime perfect otouto and perfect son to have. I love Hiiro Amagaiuhdaskf I LOVE HIIRO AMAGI AND NO ONE UNDERSTANDS HOW MUCH HE IS SO DEAR TO ME NO ONE NO ONE I DARE YOU I DARE ANYONEE TO EVEN *THINK* THAT BC NO I'LL PULL UR SOUL AWAY JUST FROM MY STRONG STARE AS U DON'T POSSIBLY GET HOW GREAT HE IS. HIIRO AMAGI FOREVER AND I'D ADOPT IN HEART BEAT even tho it'd be a bit complicated since his older bro is there btu like let's just ignore realistic sort of complications and in a simple sort of thought process he is my son now thanaadsjsnfas thankjyhktdrs thank you

> Switch /literally/ adopted him, he's the champion of found family and an absolute sunbeam who brightens the world around him and loves his friends unconditionally!! The perfect son!!

> Sora is a cutie you all are just MEAN. Sora, get behind me..,..,..

> baby boy baby

> hamster sized. put him in my pocket and feed him cheese

> My baby girl she is so precious i just love her so much. I have introject disease and just want to play video games with my daughter. Plus I just think she would make my life like 30000x better sunshine girl!!

> he is ball shaped!!! there are two subsets of ball shaped characters: 1. pet (sora) 2. punt (kogaball)
>
> btw if anyone picks nagisa they're godfather kin

> does adoptin as a siblin count? like can u do that? im gonna assume so bc then me and sora can b siblings and I love that

> so heres the thought process: i wouldnt want to adopt any of the graduate idols, they can handle themselves (i think, i hope….) so that cuts down the candidates to like.. half. also i wouldve picked hinata but i feel like him and yuuta have to come as a package deal and i think thatd be cheating so idk. same with hiiro if i adopted him id have rinne tracking my location (now that i think abt it i wouldnt mind that i need a husband to help me raise the sopping wet cat im about to adopt). anyways lets focus on sora i picked sora bc… sora js like me…. so like me…. i feel like itd be very easy to know soras needs and all that bc sora can describe to me what sora needs with like colors and shit and my autism can decode what sora is talkin abt. if i had the choice id adopt aira kohaku mika souma  and mitsuru aswell so i can lead the autism legion. also i feel like sora would be very low needs and sora would be like.. calm ig?? i mean dont get me wrong sora is practically jumping off the walls at all time but i feel like if i took sora out for a walk two times a day like a dog then sora would be very calm in the house. oh yea also wed play animal crossing together i should really work on my acnh island LOL

> Autism be damned my son knows how to work a grill 😭

> i put him in a hamster wheel and he starts generating electricity

> he does no wrong, he is amazing. i want to feed him pop rocks and Mountain Dew!

> sora owns my heart, toes, and bank account. even if i were going bankrupt i would become a vsco stripper to support our family

> Sora is very cute, he's just a silly guy who likes video games. I mean sometimes he almost gets hit by a car and gets lost because he doesn't carry his phone, but what's the point of parenthood if your child doesn't have near-death experiences on several occasions

> So-chan is a sweet boy. He indeed is energetic, but willing to help. AND HE'S FULL OF HAPPINESS, I WANNA HUGGU HIM EVERYDAY

> A lovely lil guy who deserves a good home! He deserves to be loved and cherished by all!! Friend shaped parkour gamer guy!!!

> ha ha hi hi hu hu !! hes a  silly little gamer i like him lotssss and would love for him to be my child :3

> He will hahihuheho you to death if you don't.

> my daughter... my son... I've already gotten into debt for her might as well do it again ❤️

> S crun. Gly,,)

> He's the ideal son. Like just look at him. It's like adopting a cat u see the cutest one and ur like "OH THAT ONE

> he is so son coded

> The silly I want to hold him in my palm

> smol

> Ummm BECAUSE he’s number one silly and she’s just like me frrr we can play video games allll daayyyyyy!!!!!!!!!!

> I will give him love and support and we will take over the world

> silly fun guy & he got those puppy eyes 🤞🤞

> He makes me feel like the happiest person in the world . He is such a good friend and I can really relate to the struggles he faced when he first attended yumenosaki (I am also autistic). I never want him to feel like that ever again because it truly can be one of the worst feelings in the world especially if what outcasts you is something you can't control.... not really adopting him as a parent but I will be getting my boy out the trenches!!

> Sora is simply the sweetest, loveliest, astounding, silliest, loving little guy out there and he deserves the world. Godbless, amen.

> he's literally so precious {"<"}3 i just want to give him a hug and good happy life. baby boy!!

> He is literally entirely innocent of all crime and sin. This boy has nary an evil bone in his body and deserves any and all love he gets. He will NEVER be left outside.

> what is not adoptable abt this little creature. i love him. hes so cute and i will never lose him because of his bright obnoxious hair. we will be best father son duo in the entire world.

> I love him. He's so cute and sweet and his lil HaHeHuHiHo~ is literally the cutest thing ever.

> i want to huhu into the air and play rhythm games with him he’s just a silly little guy

> Sora is just a little guy. He was raised in captivity and he has NO idea how to survive in the outside world. I chose him so he can eat pellets out of the palm of my hand every day and be misted with a spray bottle in his enclosure

> He is so sweetest crumple coded.So son shaped

> sora harukawa is my son. he is the joy of my life. the apple of my eye and my favourite colour (yellow)
>
> what do you mean you don't adore his HaHiHuHeHo? my boy still believes in santa and his favourite holiday is christmas, everyone loves him, he is adored by everyone, HE IS MY SON!!!!!!!! 
> 
> he is a very good boy.. with the exception  of climbing over walls! he's doing nothing wrong unlike his unitmates who try to murder each other! PLEASE LOVE HIM MORE!!!! my boy deserves better!!!

> this boy has the ability to sense emotions and thus would be an excellent addition to my family and home as a colorful ray of sunshine that brings happiness

> autism scrunklie we're gonna be besties

> he's just...SILLY!!! such a cute n silly gentleman actually love him would be such a nice and kind kid but also filled with wonder and that's SO CUUUUTE

> I sat here for half an hour trying to find the words as to why i made my choice. I have come to the realization that i do not need to justify my decision, its Sora. Sora is my child, no hesitation.

> id be murdered if i didnt adopt him probably idk

> He is like a little morning sunshine so bright and full of energy. I would love him like my son and give him whatever he wants. I would also learn him how to commit several crimes like stealing peoples wallets and committing theft everywhere. I will also lecture him on how to set up many types of bombs going from something small like fire crackers to Landmines and kill many innocent civilians.

> Sora would be a good son

> idk he’s just a silly little guy

> i just think sora would be wonderful to have sitting in the backseat of mt minivan and having him ask me for slime and happy meals

> Hahuhiheho

> he would be a good son. a pure son. a precious sun.

> SORA IS LITERALLY SO CUTE‼️‼️⁉️ I LOVE SORA WHOLE HEARTEDLY AND HE JUST GOESSS “HAHAHUHUHEHOOOO!!!!” come here my child we will live together in peace and harpmny

> HAVE U SEEN HIM???? HE SO CUTE I WANNA GIVE HIM ALL OF MY MORTAL POSSESSIONS TO HIM MY SWEET LIL SKRUNKLY- AND HE DESCRIBED PEOPLE USING COLORS😩🤌 MY SON I WANNA PET HIS HEAD LIKE A CAT 😭 I WANT THE BEST FOR HIM AND I WILL DO IT FOR HIM 😤💕

> HOW COULD YOU NOT ADOPT SORA YOU ARE JUST CRUEL IF YOU ARE GONNA LET HIM SAD IN A CARDBOARD BOX that's hella mean. Happy go lucky boy deserves a nice home with warm food and cozy clothes. How else can he do his cute laughs if he isn't happy? I would cherish him lots and lots IT LOOKS AS IF I HAD JUST ADOPTED A PUPPY no it's not like that I just love him love him love him I would love to make him happy he deserves the world...

> he’s my actual child i birthed him

> he’s just a silly little baby

> sora is friend shaped, i care for this little sun + i would let him play fortnite and drink cola. plus if i adopt him that means he will present me to switch, so i can talk to the babygirliest character of ensemble stars tsumugi aoba. tsumugi aoba is the nicest, prettiest and cutest angel. i talk about him everyday to my family and friends, he cured my sadness and my uglyness. i thought about him before my surgery and i woke up with a smile because he's my everything. the doctor was asking why i was talking about a wet kitten in a wet cardbox before sleeping, it's because i was talking about tsumugi aoba my beloved. tsumugi aoba brings peace on earth, and if he existed for real he would be too powerful, that's why he isn't on earth. even nature is too much a coward to bring him to life. but it's ok because when we think of him it's like he was alive, my little silly scrunkly bluebird of happiness i love him he deserves all the love of the world and that's why i'm in debt for buying a tsumugi nui.
>
> also hearing sora makes me happy :)

> Sora is just a cutie pie like you could just give him one of those electric scooters and he’ll be good for like 12 hours and then when he comes back home you give him an ipad. hes such an easy kid and he’s a cutie.

> He is so cute and we can play games together UwU

> nothing can change my mind on sora being a pathetic little sopping wet cat that's all alone and that has possibly caught a bird or two

> He's my cornson, my lil gamer baby, I'll feed him corn

> autism son needs autism father. i will make him a warm meal and teach him FE15

> I am taking him as far away from happyele as I possibly can. getting him out of there

> i could go with either of the winks bc their father sucks but it feels mean to just pick one. anyways sora just makes me sad. autism, synaesthesia, bullying etc leading him to shut himself in his room for a good portion of his childhood. like. i need to hoist him up like simba

> hes v cute n adorable he already feels like my son

> We could play video games together :3 he’d beat my ass in Mario kart and id almost start to rage about getting 2nd place but then I’d see my sons cute little face and forget all about my wrath

> Literally the I quote the best character, the kindest, most precious, and best boy of enstars

> I squish his cheeks and call him sunshine son. Sora is such a good child who is so adoptable and he just wants everyone to be happy. Doesn't mean any harm just son boy is allowed thank you,,,,

> I'm a 43-year old retired mafia hitman. I just wanted to retire alone, in quiet solitude. 
>
> Well... seven months ago, I was walking home one rainy afternoon. I had gone to the local grocer to purchase some groceries. 
>
> However, as I began to leave, using my former hitman abilities, I saw a small figure-like silhouette shift to my presence. As I looked back down to my bags... my baguette was gone! 
>
> Quickly, using my amazing hearing, I heard a crunch from the alley. 
> 
> How preposterous! 
>
> I brushed it off as a strange occurrence, walked home, but something lingered...
>
> As I started to unlock my front door, I felt someone's presence- albeit not dangerous, but still hiding.
> 
> I turned from my door to look out at the hallway, as if somebody would be there. Well, there wasn't.
>
> 'Ha, I guess the retired life is really getting to me.' 
>
> I finished unlocking the door, and quickly went inside.  
>
> I went outside the next day, and saw a small child. Or, atleast I thought it was a child. He was shivering, but appeared to be determined to speak. 
>
> Whilst he stuttered and shook, the child spit out a somewhat jumbled string of words.
>
> "I..." He choked, "Sora didn't mean to steal your bread.. Sora is sorry!" 
>
> The child was shaking like a leaf in the wind, but continued. "Sora meant to apologize earlier but... Mister's color looked tired..."
>
> 'what the actual hell'  I couldn't help but think to myself. 
>
> The child continued to stand there, looking up at me expectantly. 
>
> His blonde hair was dark from dirt, I guessed from seemingly being on the streets for a while. His clothes were ruined, shirt slightly in tatters, and his pants ripped on multiple parts of the calves and ankles.
>
> For some, stupid, unknown, goddamned reason.. my heart throbbed. I couldn't leave him out there alone. 
>
> He was on the verge on tears, most likely from my lack of response. I noticed and swiftly tried to make one. "Uh.. it-it's alright, really..." 
>
> The kid continued staring, his gaze slightly making me uncomfortable. 
>
> "...Hey, do you want a cup of water?

## 2TH PLACE -- MIKA KAGEHIRA (109 VOTES)

> IF MIKA DOESNT WIN THIS YALL ARE GOING TO HELL. *(son note: sorry.)* he was Quite Literally abandoned in a wet cardboard box all alone. please someone save my poor boyfriend

> He's so adorable,, I think that he's the only one I would actually be able to take care of LMAO

> https://youtu.be/sgsVO-Sd9-E

> he deserves nice things therefore i will adopt him and let him do his silly little things

> He’s a wet wet cat born in a cardboard box all alone and he’s never had a warm meal so I want to take him inside and give him fancy wet cat food and show him what love is

> he is literally a sopping wet cat how could you not want to adopt him

> He makes me so happy. I fart when I see him because I get filled with so much adrenaline

> He would definitely come into my room and say "I frew up" with tears in his eyes and a really messed-up but cute-looking teddy doll. Definitely the kind of kid to roll around on the floor and eat shit when he runs bc he fell, but overall very empathetic.

> eepie (and he probably is like one of yhose cats who cling to yhe ceiling i. fear.

> Mika is very humble and cute. You could give him a tortilla and he’d be happy.

> i think that mika deserves to have a meal so good its like that one scene in ratatouille where he drops the pen

> cause mika is the best, i love mika (*^3(*^o^*)

> This was a tough choice because while Nazuna’s my favorite character Mika’s already pathetic and looks like a wet rat (affectionate) not to mention I see a lot of myself in him. Also I think I’d rather shoot myself in the foot than let him be orphaned a second fucking time so yeah

> So sweet and willing to learn!! I would love to raise him into a great person/idol!!

> as soon as i see him he's gonna start staring at me with those mismatched eyes and then when i prepare to walk away hes going to start tearing up AND THE EMPATH IN ME WILL START CRYING AND THEN ILL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO TAKE HIM IN.

> [hey i realise now u mean adopt as a child. i thought u meant we were just findinf these people grown as they are in a cardboard box. this is based on that assumption. i would not adopt any child.]
>
> Shu Itsuki herself was faced with this exact scenario. And who did she pick? None other than Kagehira Mika. I will trust her judgement. ..plus he is basically a cat and I have a bad habit of getting cats to follow me home and I would want to bake for him and braid his hair and give him comfy clothes and do his makeup and we would be best friends ansn he would become best friends with my cat and sew stuffed animals and little cat toys and we could practice differnent instruments together and come up with different costume ideas and I would help him sew them more preciselyly andndjj iIh andn we could wwtch those cgi dinosaur documentaries together and I would make him play my favorite visual novels ans I could brew tea for him and we coudl have a little book club and adopt another cat togetehr and i would remekind him to sleeo and eat and brush his teethanns we wouls keep eachother in check and better eachothehr and could take long naps together and inrroduce eachotjehr to our differnet interests to broaden our horizonsnd andnbfnr and we coupd get matchign bracelelts and baxk on the topic of sewing we could have matchifnb outfits too.. we could stargaze ans make up sillyl dumb constellations and talk abour the formation of the earth and stars and [i am dragged away]

> he's an orphan i think that makes him adoptable

> The skrunkly. Cat.

> hes so cat to me and i love cats. also my cat seems to like him so they'd get along!!! i love pathetic little things who have been abanonded by everyone i love showing them the love they need and didnt know what they wanted

> He might be a little messed up in the head but look at him, he's such a skrunky meow meow, how cruel are you to see him at a pet shop and just ignore him like that, any sane person would adopt this tiny skrunky artistic baby meow meow, he'll be so grateful over such teeny tiny little thing you do to him, and and you could spoil him with the least amount of money and he'll be happy, he has POTENTIAL CONSIDER CONSIDER AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA,

> My poor baby has lived in an orphanage for the longest time and has had the worst life imaginable due to his self-image after being left alone there with no parents to guide him and tell him everything was okay. The only experience he has with his parents is that thought that he caused them to leave him and that his heterochromia ruined his life. My poor baby needs a loving family—a mom and dad or a mom and mom or a dad and dad HE JUST NEEDS PARENTS TO BE THERE FOR HIM he makes me so sad.

> I can't lie I have not a clue of Enstars lore and like I am very scared of the Enstars machine but from what my bff told me I can safely assume that Mika needs like some father or mother or whatever parental figure he can get honestly :sob:

> I was going between Rinne and Mika because I love them they're both so embarrassing and pathetic to watch. But since children are a 0/10 Mika would be the cuter less-stressful choice. He'd probably scribble a messy stick figure drawing and show it to me like "Look it's us!

> we would play with finger skates together

> he's like a little cat that screeches and makes weird noises and i do that too to cope with the evil blonde guy who likes violence that i see at 3 am in delirium (someone pick him up please he's pissing me off) so i don't know....i want to put him in moi pocket and make him cute outfits and pat his head and eat croissant with him till i die

> he is literally the scrunkliest scrimblo of all time. just a little guy. sopping wet cat of an idol. like a little disparaged victorian child. he takes one look at me with those eyes and goes ngah and i want to take him home and dry him off and give him a warm drink and tuck him into bed. son boy allowed!!!!!!

> Listen hes already an orphan,
>
> ok listen shu adopted him once i can do it again. imagine his little face with big autism creature eyes looking up from the box on the street. tell me you arent taking this wet cat of a boy home.

> He's literally like a stray cat

> Meeks... I m gonna give him a warm home and a warm blankie and some warm soup..... maybe I'll get a nibble of him in the wmeeks soup but then I'll give him a warm bubble bath... a warm bubbly meeks soup........... I could fuck up and all he does is ngahh n I am free and happy..... holds him in my arms I m cured of all worldly feelings and desires

> Hes a good boy 🥰👍

> he actually looks like he was born in a cardboard box in the rain he might have been born 2 minutes ago i can't leave him there

> He's a good boi

> He's such a sweet baby who just wants to be loved asgdjajh TAKE HIM HOME

> It’s Mika, of course you’ll adopt him. He’s absolutely cute, “nnah”, can cook, sew, sing, dance and basically anything so just give him love and attention that he deserves and never abandon him. Plus, he’ll be there whenever you feel down and will do anything to cheer you up. Just that will make your whole day filled with happiness.

> Hes so cute hes adorable hes a little creepy silly dummy baby and ivlove him sm. I can give him burnt cookies and he will be happy, i want to eat him and watch creepy animes w him while we eat candies. I wanna sleep w him, he def looks adorable spleeping hugging his plushie, i also wanna hear his ngah the whole day

> cute cute adorable cat soaking in the box how can i not adopt her

> I've already spent soo much money and time on him, I'd even put him on my will if I can

> my chompie chomp is too cute‼️‼️

> Mika was the reason I came to enstars, so yeah. AND HE IS SO CUET AND LOVES PLUSH TOYS, SUCH TRUE, SUCH A TREASURE MUST BE KEPT
>
> (Cmon, i have place for two GIME AND HIIRO)

> As a Shu kinnie I simply have to

> Skrunkly man mmm skrunkly baby my big baby he deserves the world and more i will be his mother his father his guardian his everything mmm sweet darling

> he skrunkly so goofy haha

> Cuz like I feel like one day I bee walking in French or whatever and I see THE MIKA KAGEHIRA SHIVERING AND COLD AND NO SHU TO BE SEEN. So of course I gotta do what I gotta do best, kidnapping children’s- I mean adopting and sheltering them ❤️ (most sane enstars fan)

> He is cat energy. that's it

> because mika is a stinky boy

> If I adopt Mika I'll attract his owner shu itsuki then after 1 hour I'll also attract arashi with sweets its hitting 3 cats with 1 stone (whatever) I get to see the shumika dynamic in my house everyday when I wake up and come home from work arashi will be cheering on her bestest friend forever. Mika gives out adopt me vibes but we all know shu would adopt him but still I really wanna adopt mika so much if I do I'll be hitting 3 cats with 1 stone buy 1 take 2 for free.

> He is literally an orphan plz adopt him

> Shu picked up Mika and so do I

> If Mika was a kid and was abandoned he’s look like a pathetic wet mutt but in a cute way, I’d adopt him and give him an education and food and warmth and shelter and grow him to be a fine young man with an autistic hyperfixation on teddy bears. 
>
> If Mika wants a teddy, I’ll get him one.
>
> If Mika wants the entire teddy isle, I’ll buy it.
>
> If Mika wants the whole toy store, from my eyes Mika we’re getting you that store😤
>
> All Mika has to do is be as cute as he is (effortlessly bro ain’t even gotta try) and I’m getting him everything. 
>
> He’s the most adorable skrunkly and thinking he’d be pocket-sized and so much more energetic is so much more endearing- how can you let someone like that be in the rain holding onto a cardboard box for a home⁉️
>
> Imma raise my boy the way he deserves to be raised🗣‼️‼️😭❤️🔛🔝🔥

> definitely mika, from what ive seen in his relationship with shu he'd def be adoptable. he'd be a great child, he'd help you with things you don't understand/don't know how to do IDKKKK he seems like it:( he's a lovable and caring person so yes. hes adoptable and i'd adopt him

> HE IS CHILD. the scrunkly :3 i love him

> meowmeow coded

> hes just a funky lil guy....... he can do no wrong... i give him food and love and all he needs to do is exist and i will be happy

> come on. have you seen him. he was literally designed to be a sopping wet cat. He is the textbook definition of a sopping wet cat. Everything about him screams cat that is sopped and wet.

> he just a lil babey 😢 a skrumkle 🥺 my lil eepie 🥹

> I would give her all the candy in the worldddddddd. As I feel like at the same time mika is adoptable, she would also be the most likely to adopt,,,,

> if i dont tuck him into bed, read him a bedtime story, and kiss him goodnight i will DIE

> wet cat

> Bros the closest thing to a cat you can get. He’ll just stare off into space or something and is just a silly cat. Just make sure to bring Shu along lol

> He's so skrunkly, tootsie doop, silly boy, like a cat.... I love him.... my little mipy

> Her homophobic eyes are obviously her defining feature that makes her so adorable. I love my pet cat Kagehira Mika.

> I just think mika is a good boy. He's cute. He can help me with the chores. I just want to make him happy And he most likely didn't want anything fancy because I'm broke.

> he gives off wet cardboard cat energy

> i need to take such good care of him I'd be so gentle and loving and caring an

> I just wanna spoil him tbh, he can have a million teddy bears and eat as much candy as he wants

> He was born in a wet cardboard box all alone. He reminds me of my cat. I don’t cook often but I feel like if I just made him a tiny snack he’d be very grateful. Once again like my cat.

> My mother instincts kick in with Valkyrie, they’re all traumatized and I’m going to take care of them.

> he's an orphan who hangs out in garbage dumps PLEASE let me bring him inside and take care of him

> mikas too good 🙌🙌

> I mean isn't that what shu did?

> How can you ignore this poor little mika sitting in a box and crying?
>
> OK I admit I am biased coz I am Mila oshi I love him I will feed him

> if i leave him on the road he may die

> Mika needs lists of help with self care and I’m going to force him into better caring habits.

> sad wet cat.....

> shinobu is my little eepy boy. hes my little skrunkly patootsie. i see him and i see myself when i was youngwr and he makes me so emotional in such a fucked up way. hes such an ipad fnaf kid he likes minecraft hes just like me. no one but me deserves him. im going to make him mac n cheese. i'll bake him peanut butter cookies. i'll order him dominos lava cake every tuesday to scare away the mental illness. hes my everything.

> im so worried hes going to get cold out there. i saw him in that box and i got worried. hes going to catch a cold!!!!

> i imagined calling them "son" and went for the one that felt the most natural

> BRO WHY IS ALL THE IDOLS OUTSIDE IN THE RAIN WHO LET THIS HAPPEN? I love Shinobu so much,,, but I’m starting to wonder where u got this idea from-

> he is MY SON i would do anything to protect him from any harm yes ofc i will be a ninja with u would u like a cup of tea a bedtime story i will tuck him into bed after lifting him out of a cardboard box where he has been abandoned on the side of the road looking like a soaking wet kitten with no one to love him. i will protect him from this cruel harsh world that only seeks to push terror and fear into the hearts of the innocents, the innocents in question being my son sengoku shinobu. Also he hasnt come home and i think at this point i have to drag him by the ears and bring him home under the eyes of the law.

> Baby... Cutie ..... Who wouldnt want to adopt his adorable cute face , i believe his cheeks are like mochi , squishy and stretchi ,downside is that hes probably good at hiding but who cares you will still see his face once in a while , i would spoil him with whatever he wants , even if its the 70$ strawberry i would buy it for him, he wants a whole mansion ? Aight bet , i love shinobu so much hes such a little cutie

> i want cool ninja shit and it would be more socially acceptable to say its for my child than myself

> HE IS MY SON. HE IS SO SMALL. I'LL LISTEN TO HIM RAMBLING ABOUT HOW COOL NINJAS ARE AND AGREE FOR EVERY SINGLE WORD HE SAYS EVEN IF I DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT IS HE TALKING ABOUT. I JUST WANT TO SEE HIM HAPPY I SWEAR I'LL JOIN HIS NINJA ASSOCIATION AND BUY HIM COUNTLESS WEAPONS WITH THE NONEXISTENT MONEY I HAVE IF THAT MEANS I'LL SEE HIM SMILING AND JUMPING FROM JOY

> He’s me and my boyfriend son ! He’s our precious squirrel that I want to hug

> Shinobu is so SO good literally not one bad bone in him. Even though I'm a knightsP I can't leave Shinobu in the rain I'll pick him up and take him to the toy store and buy him all the ninja toys he wants. What a good boy.

> HE HAS RUNT ENERGY i need to adopt him or else he will DIE!!!!

> he's a baby trying to navigate the world but he's a baby so he's learning and also he's younger than me he makes a very good son

> shinobu is so scrimbly. just the scronkiest. would love to indulge in his ninja hyperfixation. also he has pet frogs. i love frogs imagine having a son with two pet frogs. also i just feel like he needs a stable sense of family bc poor kid has been through a lot in regards to his unit and is very easily anxious. anyways vote shinobu he is very precious ( i was actually gonna vote for sora dont tell anyone ab that though )

> HES SOOOO SILLY id make sure he wouldnt get stuck in any moar trees... my sweet sweet boy

> he’s just a guy…he’s just a silly little guy who was born in a wet cardboard box all alone…i can’t turn a blind eye to a sopping wet cat like him

> Shinobu is my son he's so cute and adorable very adoptable 🥺

> i need to buy him a lego ninjago set

> ill provide for him all the frog things his heart desires all the ninja equipment he could only dream hell I'll even learn some super secret ninja art so that I can bond with him even more he wants to be the best ninja I'll become better than him and teach him so that he can surpass me one day as I lay there in the rain proud that he's beaten me and reached the end of his ninja training 
>
> Also I really love his way of talking and big puffy cheeks it's sooo cute!!

> shinobu is a little guy. he would be the BEST option because he’s just a little guy!! so very little that he can fit in your palm… he is pocket sized. he is a friendly creature. he is like a good luck charm… if he was by my side all the time nothing bad would ever happen! i walk out in traffic with him holding my hand and i will be safe all the way until i reach the other side. if a fire broke out in my house, there would be some water leaking and instantly put out the flame because he is with me. if there was a natural disaster like a tornado or hurricane… i would never fear because i have shinobu by my side. he will keep me safe and i will keep him safe as well. he is my little baby forever!!!! my little goofy goober!!! i would adopt him andgive him the best birthday parties and make sure he has lots of fun friends to play with! i will be the best caretaker there is when it comes to shinobu. i will feed him and his frogs. i will be there for him when he is at his lowest. i will be there.

> cute baby angel sweet beautiful boy 💕

> Cause he's really cute, I'm obsessed with little nin nin💕💕

> He is so tiny. You don’t need to adopt him you can just grab him by the scruff with one hand and gently place him into your pocket. I love little ninja boy. I have already adopted him he’s so prescious

> i Want to take care of him. i think that he would be very polite and he would be a good son. i want to buuy him little outfits and make breakfast for him and take him out places so he can have sleepovers with his friends. i thjink that if i saw him in  wet cardboard box all alone i would want to pick him up and take him home... ooouuugh.....sucha cutie.......

> my shinonui is very loved hes my son my pride and joy i love my autistic ninja son i would listen to him talk about ninjas 24/7 hes very silly

> Smol cute little ninja

> Because every time i think of him the same age as the kids i work with i want to cry. Hes little. He loves so fiercely. Hes a little dork. I had a ninja phase in middle school i would support him so much. Iwant to pack him little froggie cookies in his lunchbox and add more to share with his friends. I’ll wake him up and help him pick out his outfit and listen to him as i make him breakfast. Cry when i send him to school bc i miss him and then. When he gets home with him play until it’s time for dinner. I’m a boy mom through and through and i want to listen to him talk about frogs and ninjas and everything he likes. I would do anything for him

> he will be very safe and  i definitely will not eat him

> he's the cutest character. you're telling me you would avoid him, sopping wet in the cold, with his big eye staring up at u? Heartless

> he do the silly ninja things :)

> Meepy....

> I dunno he is just so adorab;e ggnnnhhh such a cute small baby

> the embodiment of a little wet kitten left in a cardboard box in the rain

> he is so small. he will shrink in water fountains and collect the change in there so we can afford the wendy 4 for 4. hes also so sqishy to me i have tears in my eyes

> WE WOULD GO ON NINJA ADVENTURES TOGETHER DE GOZARU

> I adopt Shinobu not like a son but like a younger brother yknow? He is a silly little guy 2 me I love him

> He is my son, I will keep him warm and give him love. I will buy him a frog shaped bed and a frog chair and a frog table and a frog.

> Shinobu is my world, I open my eyes every morning and go, "ah yes, best boy Shinobu". I am a proud mother of way too many adopted fictional characters anyway, another one won't hurt right?? Have you seen how tiny he is compared to a majority of his peers? I feel like if you aren't looking, you might just accidentally kick him across the room and that's something no one needs bc a sad Shinobu is not allowed (unless Happy Ele decides they want to make yet another card to monetize off his tears). And sure, he came from a loving and supportive household but like???? I'll be his third loving parent, it'll be just fine. Imagine being his parents, I'm literally green with envy I want to be them so bad,,,, Like whose soul do I have to sacrifice to what supernatural entity in order to become his parents,,,, like my options are to either sell someone's soul or to commit identity theft, that's how much I want to adopt Shinobu Sengoku as my own child

> He's my son

> just look at him

> He's just. Squishy lil guy i love him he's silly ninja guy and so small

> If I don't adopt him, his color coded friends will track me down.

> My son, my sunshine ,my everloving cute adorable little winky twinky smushy wushy mushy shinobu baby never stop de gozaruing forever

> small......cute......I can neglect him from time to time under the guise of ninja training......won't pester me to buy him expensive shit like tori would......yeah

> SHINOBU MY LITTLE BABY THE LIGHT OF MY LIFEEEEE MY SMOL LIDDOL MEOW MEOW MY BABY PIEE MY SWEETIE PIEEEE

> perhaps it’s the fate of all MayoiPs to feel this way but something about shinobu activates all of my maternal instincts. i could be a good mother to him, i would pick him up after school and let him take my umbrella if it was raining so his books don’t get soggy. he’s so sweet and i would let him bring all of ryuseitai home for dinner and i’d always help them with their homework because any of shinobu’s friends are basically my kids by extension. i want to comfort him when he’s sad and brush his hair all neat before class picture day. if he was a kindergartener and he drew pictures for me in class i would keep them all in a ring binder. i love shinobu he’s my little froggy.

> the scrunkl eepy poopy doo

> BABYBABYBABYBABYDEGOZARU

> He’s just. A baby,, I wanna give him hot chocolate and pjs :(

> he’s so precious it makes me wanna cry i wanna squish his wittle cheeks

> nice :) i dont think he'd causemuch trouble UNLIKE SOEM CHARACTERS. he is a good kid with good intentions and probably decent enough grades...maybe./. only downfall is ur going to find much ninja equipment around the house but he is nice enough to pick it up for u

> he’s like a wet cat in a cardboard box youd find in a dark alleyway. if i saw that creature u best know im adopting it. that id now my most precious child

> i kin kanata

> this is my beautiful son of 17 years i treat them better then i treat myself and anyone else i would pick him up out of his cardboard box and bring him to my house and feed him as many treats in the world that he wants i would make umeboshi for him at any chance i would learn how to cook and bake so i could give her any meal that she soforth desires i would work three jobs just to be able to afford the amount of 2wink merch they want to buy i would go with him to 2wink's concerts so she doesnt have to go alone i would literally die for him i think shinobu sengoku is the light of my life and i would go to the ends of the earth for him i just watched their new spp while writing this and started crying i love shinobu sengoku

> just look at him. i want to give him the best life i can. he sparks a motherly instinct in me that nothing else does not even MY OWN CAT. and so much enrichment will be in his enclosure i PROMISE

> I would be a ninja with him. Like he seems like such a fun kid to have and I will willingly GIVE HIM THE WORLD!!

> NIN NIN
>
> …
> He’s the sweetest boy, loves his friends and always true to himself I wanna give him so much love and cuddles and kisses, I’d make him his favourite food all the time and give him everything he needs to take care of his frogs (HE HAS PET FROGS) he loves everyone so much and he can be a little shy but he’s so silly and lovely and he always works so hard he’s always so nice and kind and he’s the sweetest ever, like his smile makes my teeth rot sweet (HIS NEW WHITE DAY CARD WITH THE COOKIES??? HIS SMILE IS EVERYTHING) he’s always so considerate and he’s always anxious about overstepping and he fights so hard for his home (B&E ALL FOR RYUSEITAI) my ninja boy (HE LIKES NINJAS) he never changed himself for anyone and he’s always so supportive of everyone HE WORKS SO HARD (and I’m sorry I promise ryuseitai is one of my favourite units but shinobu deserves better [IK HED NEVER LEAVE CAUSE HE LOVES RYUSEITAI BUT STILL]) 
TLDR: I LOVE MY NIN NIN BOY AND I WILL ALWAYS SUPPORT HIM IN EVERY AND ANY WAY POSSIBLE NIN NIN SHINOBU SENGOKU THE WORLD NIN NIN

> what would you do if you see a ninja with purple hair swooped to the side covering one eye with yellow streaks in a wet cardboard box ? he is freezing and needs a home and he’s looking at you with a face that says “please take me in :(“ you couldn’t help but say no. you take him in and you enroll him in the prestigious academy, yumenosaki gakuen. he becomes friends with 4 silly people and together, they become a j-pop idol group. also known as ryuseitai. they perform together and they skyrocket in popularity and now you sit there in front of your tv, admiring abt how far this ninja you found in a wet cardboard box has become.

> literally my child. i love him❤️❤️ cutest lil guy who couldn't love him

> Most pinchable cheeks in ensemble square. He's such a sweet boy, you just know his grandparents brag about him all the time and all the other old people get jealous

> When Shinobu is sad, I am sad, if I see him looking at me crying with that big eye I wouldn't be able to live with the guilt if I didn't take him in

> he must be protected at all costs

> he is just a littl babey

> unfortunately, for all of the other ensemble FLOPS, there is quite literally no other answer to this prompt besides our resident ninja shinobu sengoku. there are several reasons for this, both on a physiological level as well as psychological. 
>
> to begin, it is a fact of humankind that shinobu is the most mippy cutie skrunkly skrimblo to ever appear on the face of the earth. let it be known that he is a mere 160cm (still taller than half the enstarries tho) and 50kg. this boy is small enough to hold gently in your hand. if you passed him on the side of the road in a cardboard box during a monsoon, he might quite literally blow away. however, his cuteness extends further than just how tiny he is, and how his Chuunibyou haircut makes his design so unique and loveable. this child is so precious, that whenever he gets passionate about the things he likes, characters have CANONICALLY stated that he gets a twinkle in his eye that makes everybody around him feel the same about whatever he is interested in. this ALONE would likely trigger a maternal instinct among every living and deceased human being on the planet, but it doesn't stop there. shinobu is one of, if not the MOST, caring ensemble star in the entire game. 
gonna do a quick lore drop real quick, shinobu was bullied so much before yumenosaki that one of his main reasons for attending were to make a friend, even though he had NEVER had one in his life before. he had severe social anxiety, but he worked through it with the help of people like ryuseitai, anzu, yuuta, and makoto, and now he is helping OTHER people like Mayoi work through their social anxiety. because HE GETS IT!!! he also supported tetora so much- when Ryuseitai-N was formed after chiaki and kanata graduated. tetora felt very insecure, but shinobu said he was a great leader with his own sense of justice and shinobu would believe in him. shinobu as well helped to intervene in the fight tetora and midori had in climax (read it now). there are several other stories in which he plays an important role in making things right and doing good deeds, but i am just naming two off of the top of my head.
Additionally, his obsession with ninjas, which is also extremely endearing and completely harmless (listen to his solo i dare you) stems from his past, because he believed he was training to be a ninja, and ninjas work alone, which he deduced was why everyone didn't want to be his friend. if you aren't crying yet, he has two pet frogs named Peachy and Thunder, who hold the title (in shinobu's own words) as his first friends. though he is silly and likes to have fun climbing walls, as any child should, he knows how to adapt, change, and be a strong, empathetic and caring person without ANY judgement. yes, shinobu has never done ANYTHING wrong in the entire story of ensemble stars, and if you believe otherwise, don't worry! it is okay to be wrong sometimes!
with this, i must rest my case. now, go ahead and try to name a character more adoptable than him. i will not call out any of your favs, because that isn't the way of the ninja. but if shinobu was my legally adopted son (as if he wasn't already), you best believe that i would be so proud of that child for overcoming everything and becoming the amazing idol he is today. and THAT's on nin☆nin de gozaru.

> shoobie ……..

> How can you say no to him. Have you seen his unbloomed event center card where hes crying imagine thats how hes loiking up at you with round, watery eyes BEGGING for a warm and caring home. how can you say no. I would drip dead in the spot actually. I'll buy him all ninja related things he asks for, I'll even sell my kidney for him RAFFGGHSGAGHF GHRHT *converts the shape of every single one of my cells to turn into a perfect sphere* I LOVE MY MIPPY

> my son... he is my son

> HNGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAA

> he is TOL CUTE and precious

> hes friend shaped. if i saw him in cardboard box sopping wet all alone and crying i would cry too!!!!

> HE IS EASY TO PUT INTO POCKETS!!

> Grape

> HE’S A LITTLE NINJA!!!!!!! all his cards r very cute and i believe he would make a great son :)

> who wouldn't want to adopt a ninja hero?! he'll always make sure you are safe and happy!!!! but be careful...when he uses stealth hes hard to find. but he would be so sweet and always do his best!

> i don't even read ryuusetai stories he just looks "scrunkly" as the kids call them nowadays

> I think I could train him to be stronger than naruto

> He’s my son and I. Will. Protect. Him.

> How could you not want to adopt ahinobu hes so adorable the first time i saw him i was like i need to put him in my basement but in a /pos way like he will be taken very good care of and ofc he will get to keep peachy and thunder but yes pls adopt shinobu he has that little bro aura that you just wanna take care of but also Bully rlly hard so its like u get a cute hamster but u also get to make fun of it like why is my hasmter so fucking duumbbbbb

> i am so passionate about my shinobu son agenda. he is the perfect son, he is so kind, so sweet, so cute, so adorable, i could hope for nothing more. he is passionate, he is a NINJA??? he can bust a move, you know what he would probably make me breakfast in bed to make his father happy. i love him so much. i could write a fucking novel with just my words on how much i love him. he would never be a problem child either he would just be happy and i would be a PROUD FATHER. we would do family bonding activities every weekend where we just go hang out like play sports go to trampoline parks go to the aquarium go to the beach and i think i would cry seeing my sons face light up every time he's happy. i can imagine doing his hair in the morning to style it the perfect way, helping him practice a new kick or flip, helping him with schoolwork and being like a true dad and son and watching he proud together and getting every question wrong. in other words, he is my son in spirit and i would genuinely do anything for shinobu. i am pouring my heart out about shinobu. please accept my love writing enstars twt

> Because he’s the goofiest goober ever 😻‼️

> SON BOY SON BOY SON BOY SON BOY SON BOY SON BOY SON BOY SON BOY SON BOY SON BOY SON BOY SON BOY SON BOY SON BOY SON BOY

> littlest guy ever hes just silly and awesome

> hes like an abandoned baby squirrel shivering from the cold that i need to nurse back to health by feeding it kitten formula by syringe every two hours. my darling son

> Have you SEEN his face????

> shh,inob,,,u,,,,,, shes so nice to everybody and she is very short perfect height for piggyback rides. i want to hold her hand as she crosses the street and make her mac n cheese for dinner and tuck her in for bed and read her a story she is literally my daughter.

> he’s a little kitten in a wet cardboard box at the side of the freeway :(

> i think shinobu is a great candidate for being adoptable, not because he's a nice and well-behaved person or whatever but because i as a parent would be an enabler and as an autistic person myself i would never let shinobu's love for ninja's be surpressed in any way. imagine the phone calls home you'd get from being shinobu's parent, like- in canon theres a handful of instances where he got into trouble with akiomi, thats not a problem for me personally and i wouldn't even get mad at him for anything like- oh he got into detention because he climbed up the walls and hit somebody in the face with his shuriken's? well maybe that person should've paid attention to their surroundings and gotten out of the way, why is it shinobu's fault?? why are you trying to prohibit him from engaging with his special interest hm? oh he got into a fight because someone dissed ninja's in front of him? well maybe that person should've watched their big fucking mouth! that's what you get for talking shit about an autistic kids special interest!

> Shinobu because I need a ninja boy to get my microwavable quesadilla without making noise at 3:28 am.

and that's all!! thank you so much for sticking with me for this survey. i'll be posting the least adoptable results tomorrow!
