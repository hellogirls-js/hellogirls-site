# testing, testing!

hello! i just wanna test mdx on the site. i'm really proud of myself for getting so much done in such a short amount of time. anyways, i'll be using this page format for simpler pages that use mdx. you'll see the marriage survey results on here soon enough! my twitter account is [@HELLOGlRLS](https://twitter.com/HELLOGlRLS) and i post things such as:

- funny content
- ensemble stars
- dumb shit

__my top three enstars characters are__

1. **niki!!**
2. mayoi
3. *tomoya*

export default ({ children }) => <MDXTemplate meta={meta}>{children}</MDXTemplate>

export async function getServerSideProps() {
  return {
    props: {
      title: meta.title,
    },
  };
}
