|NOUN_1| is one of my favorite tastes. Not only that, but |NOUN_2| smell |ADJECTIVE_1|. It makes me go a little |ADJECTIVE_2| on it to be honest. Like, I cannot get it far enough down my |NOUN_3| to be |ADJECTIVE_3|. I’m only |ADJECTIVE_3| when I feel those |ADJECTIVE_4|, |ADJECTIVE_5|, |ADJECTIVE_6|, |ADJECTIVE_7| pumps of |NOUN_4| down my |NOUN_3|. When I sit back on my |BODYPART_1|, look up at you with |NOUN_5| all over my |BODYPART_2| and |NOUN_6| running down my |NOUN_7|, |NOUN_8| all |ADJECTIVE_8| and wipe my |NOUN_9| with the back of my |NOUN_10| and ask you if I did a |ADJECTIVE_9| job and you cannot even speak because I’ve drained all of your |NOUN_11| out the tip of your |NOUN_12|….. That’s when I’m |ADJECTIVE_10|.
