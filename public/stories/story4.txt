hey |NOUN_1| fandom (|NOUN_1| kin included, ive seen you do this before). i see you making fun of |NOUN_2|. you're underestimating |ENSTARSUNIT_1|, i think. you're the |ADJECTIVE_1| ones, and youre the next ones our unit is going to |VERB_1| have you forgotten that we're still considered yumenosaki's most |ADJECTIVE_2| unit? have you forgotten the events of the |NOUN_3|? we still have it in us. dont treat our |NOUN_4| like a joke, and don't |VERB_2| us.
