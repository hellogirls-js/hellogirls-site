Hello! I have been following your |NOUN_1_PLURAL| for the past |NUMBER_1| days, and have come to the conclusion you do not deserve to have |NAME_1| on your |NOUN_2|. He is my |ADJECTIVE_1| character and seeing him in a |NOUN_3| not meant for him brings me |NOUN_4|, so I will be expecting a reply to this |NOUN_5| when you have him in |NOUN_6_PLURAL| and ready to |VERB_1| him to someone who will |VERB_2| him like he deserves.
